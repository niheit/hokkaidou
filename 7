                               Introduction

   When I worked for Hokkaidô University (Faculty of Letters, from 2010 to 
2021), I guided many excursions in Hokkaidô. This article is written based on 
my excursion notes. (by T. Nihei)

Oshima [o-shi-ma 渡島] is a sub-prefecture in south Hokkaidô (Dô-nan). It is 
located in the south and the east of the Oshima Peninsula. It faces Uchiura Bay 
(Volcano Bay), Tsugaru Strait, and the Sea of Japan. #1
   Compared to other areas in Hokkaidô, temperature is high and snowfall is 
low. By Köppen's climate classification, the coast of Matsumae Town in Oshima 
sub-prefecture is classified as Cfa (humid subtropical), whereas most areas of 
Hokkaidô is classified as Dfb (humid continental, cool summer). In the case of 
Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture, the mean annual temperature is 9.1 °C 
(average from 1981 to 2010), the mean annual precipitation is 1152 mm, and the 
mean annual snowfall is 381 cm. #2
   The name Oshima is Japanese. The pronunciation of the Kanji characters 
Watari-shima [渡島] changed to Oshima. It means ``across, island.''
   In the mid 15th century, Japanese forts (Tate) were established. In the Edo 
era (17th to 19th centuries), the area was ruled by the Matsumae Domain and 
sometimes by the Tokugawa Shogunate (see Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-
prefecture for the old forts; see Matsumae Town and Hakodate City in Oshima 
sub-prefecture for the history in the Edo era). 
   After the Meiji period, in 1869 (Meiji 2), Oshima country (Oshima-no-kuni
[渡島国]) was established. The Hokkaidô Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi) 
was built in Hakodate. In 1871 (Meiji 4), the Hokkaidô Development Commission 
moved to Sapporo, and Hakodate's building became a branch. In 1879 (Meiji 12), 
administrative offices for counties (Gun-yakusho [郡役所]) were established. 
Administrative offices (Kochô-yakuba [戸長役場]) for villages and towns were 
established (administrative offices (Kochô-yakuba) before this year were a 
continuation of village and town headmen from the Edo era). 
   In 1882 (Meiji 15), the Hokkaidô Development Commission was abolished, and 
prefectures of Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro were established. In 1886 (Meiji 
19), the three prefectures were abolished, and Hokkaidô Prefecture Office 
(Hokkaidô-chô) was established. In 1897 (Meiji 30), administrative offices for 
counties were abolished, and sub-prefectures of Hakodate, Kameda, and Matsumae 
were established. In 1899 (Meiji 32), Hakodate sub-prefecture merged Kameda 
sub-prefecture. In 1903 (Meiji 36), Hakodate sub-prefecture merged Matsumae 
sub-prefecture. Meiji was a turbulent period. 
   In 1922 (Taishô 11), Hakodate sub-prefecture was renamed Oshima sub-
prefecture. In 2010, Oshima General Sub-prefectural Bureau (Oshima-sôgô-shinkô-
kyoku) was established.
   These are municipalities in Oshima; Hakodate 279,127 people in 2010 (3rd 
largest in Hokkaidô), Hokuto 48,032, Nanae 28,453, Yakumo 18,896, Mori 17,859, 
Matsumae 8748, Oshamambe 6386, Kikonai 5386, Fukushima 5114, Shiriuchi 5074, 
and Shikabe 4767. The sub-prefectural bureau is located in Hakodate.

   #1 Volcano Bay is Funka-wan in Japanese. It was named in 1796 by British 
naval officer William Robert Broughton. At the time, volcanoes erupted around 
the bay. The shape of the bay looks like a caldera, but there is no caldera 
as large as this in the whole country (the largest one is Kussharo Caldera, see 
Teshikaga Town in Kushiro sub-prefecture).
   #2 As for climate, in the case of Tokyo (Chiyoda Ward), the mean annual 
temperature is 15.4 °C (average from 1981 to 2010) and the mean annual rainfall 
is 1529 mm. The climate of Tokyo is classified as Cfa (humid subtropical).
   For the coldest month, the mean temperature in Tokyo is 5.2 °C in January. 
The mean temperature in Hakodate is -2.6 °C in January. For the hottest month, 
the mean temperature in Tokyo is 26.4 °C in August. The mean temperature in 
Hakodate is 22.0 °C in August.

Hiyama [hi-ya-ma 檜山] is a sub-prefecture in south Hokkaidô (Dô-nan). It is 
located in the west of the Oshima Peninsula. It faces the Sea of Japan. The 
area is divided into north and south. #1
   The climate is relatively mild compared to other areas in Hokkaidô, due to 
the influence of the warm Tsushima Current. It is windy in winter. According to 
Köppen's climate classification, most areas in Hiyama is classified as Dfb 
(humid continental, cool summer), however, coasts of Esashi Town and Okushiri 
island are classified as Cfa (humid subtropical) and other coasts are 
classified as Cfb (temperate oceanic). The population is distributed along the 
coast. In the case of Esashi Town, the mean annual temperature is 10.1 °C 
(average from 1981 to 2010), the mean annual precipitation is 1197 mm, and the 
mean snowfall is 330 cm. #2
   The name Hiyama is Japanese. ``Hi-yama'' means ``cypress [ˈsai-pres], 
mountain.'' It was suggested by Takeshirô Matsuura in the beginning of the 
Meiji period, because a lot of Hiba (a kind of cypress) grew in the area. 
During the Edo era, after the late 17th century, the Matsumae Domain felled and 
sold the cypress trees. #3 #4
   The history of Japanese immigration to Hiyama is long. In the mid 15th 
century, the Andô clan built 12 forts in today's Hiayama and Oshima sub-
prefectures. In the Edo era, the south of today's Hiyama sub-prefecture was 
ruled by the Matsumae Domain and, at one time, by the Tokugawa Shogunate. #5
   After the Meiji period, in 1869 (Meiji 2), the area was included in Oshima-
no-kuni (Oshima country [渡島国]) and Shiribeshi-no-kuni (Shiribeshi country 
[後志国]). In 1872 (Meiji 5), Esashi office of the Hokkaidô Development 
Commission was built. In 1897 (Meiji 30), Hiyama sub-prefecture (Hiyama-shichô 
[檜山支庁] was established. It was separated from Oshima and Shiribeshi 
countries. In 2010, Hiyama Sub-prefectural Bureau (Hiyama-shinkô-kyoku) was 
established.
   These are municipalities in Hiyama; Setana 9590 (people in 2010), Esashi 
9004, Imakane 6186, Kaminokuni 5428, Assabu 4409, Otobe 4408, and Okushiri 
3033. The sub-prefecture bureau is located in Esashi Town.
   Hiyama is the sub-prefecture with the smallest population. All 
municipalities are designated as depopulated areas (Kaso-chiiki). 

   #1 As for the shape of Hiyama sub-prefecture, there used to be Kumaishi Town 
in the middle part. Kumaishi was merged to Yakumo Town in Oshima sub-prefecture 
at Pacific Ocean side in 2005.
   #2 As for climate, in the case of Tokyo (Chiyoda Ward), the mean annual 
temperature is 15.4 °C (average from 1981 to 2010) and the mean annual rainfall 
is 1529 mm. The climate of Tokyo is classified as Cfa (humid subtropical).
   For the coldest month, the mean temperature in Tokyo is 5.2 °C in January. 
The mean temperature in Esashi is -0.8 °C in January. For the hottest month, 
the mean temperature in Tokyo is 26.4 °C in August. The mean temperature in 
Esashi is 22.6 °C in August.
   #3 The name Hiyama was suggested by Takeshirô Matsuura, an explorer of Ezo 
(old Hokkaidô) in the Edo era. The name was reported in his book Ezochi-gunmei-
no-gi-torishirabe-sho [Record about county names in Ezo region 
蝦夷地郡名之儀取調書], which was submitted to the Meiji government in 1869 
(Meiji 2). 
   Before the Edo era, in the 15th century, the Andô clan migrated to Ezo and 
built 15 forts. Then, the Andô clan returned to the main land (today's Honshû 
island) and built Hiyama Castle (see Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture). 
Takeshirô Matsuura may have quoted the name of the old castle.
   #4 As for the name Hiyama (cypress mountain), cypress trees in south 
Hokkaidô and Aomori prefectures are called Hinoki-asunaro or Hiba, whereas 
cypress trees in the main island (Honshû) usually means Hinoki.
   Hôryûji Temple, the oldest wooden building in the country, rebuilt in 670, 
is made of Hinoki. Carpenters considered Hinoki to be the most suitable wood 
for buildings.
   ``Hinoki-asunaro'' means ``tomorrow, I will be Hinoki'' in Japanese. This 
means the wood is inferior to Hinoki, however, actually, Hinoki-asunaro also 
provides good wood. Hinoki-asnaro grows slowly and steadily.
   The leaves of Hinoki-asunaro are denser than Hinoki. Hinoki-asunaro grows 
slower than Hinoki, Sugi (ceder), and Todo-matsu (Hokkaidô's fir). It grows 
even on shady north slopes and moist soils along the sea. The wood of Hinoki-
asunaro has a tight grain (less likely to warp) and is resistant to moisture 
(less likely to rot). It was used for pillars, bathtubs, boats, bridges, and 
cutting boards.
   The natural forests of cypress (Hinoki-asunaro) in Hiyama sub-prefecture 
were said ``very good trees from the coast,'' however, most of them were lost 
for felling and fires in the Edo era. Today, two natural forests are preserved 
in the remote mountains. They have been designated as National Natural 
Monuments (see Assabu and Esashi towns for the cypress felling).
   #5 As for the history of Hiyama sub-prefecture, a high school teacher said, 
``Hiyama's culture is different from other parts of Hokkaidô. You will know 
when you go festivals.''

Matsumae [ma-tsu-ma-e 松前] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, south Hokkaidô 
(Dô-nan). It is located in the southwest of the Oshima Peninsula (the part is 
called Matsumae Peninsula). Matsumae is the southernmost municipality in 
Hokkaidô. The area faces the Tsugaru Strait and the Sea of Japan. It includes 
islands of Ôshima and Kojima on the Sea of Japan. #1 #2
   The area of Matsumae is mountainous (forests occupy 87%) and rivers are 
short. Mt. Daisengen (1072 m) stands to the north. There used to be a gold mine 
in the mountain (see Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the gold 
miners). The climate along the coast is classified as Cfa (humid subtropical) 
by Köppen's climate classification (almost all parts of Hokkaidô are classified 
as Dfb; humid continental, cool summer). Camellia and Môsô bamboo grow in 
Matsumae.
   The name Matsumae was derived from the Ainu word ``Mat-oma-i (woman, live, 
place).'' It signify the uniqueness of the place where Japanese women live. In 
Ezo (old Hokkaidô), most Japanese people returned to their homelands in winter. 
Matsumae was the territory of the Japanese (they could reproduce).
   As for history, in 720, the place name Watari-shima-tsugaru-tsu [渡島津軽津] 
was recorded. It meant a port (tsu [津]) between Watari-shima (now Hokkaidô 
Prefecture) and Tsugaru (now Aomori Prefecture). It was today's Port of 
Matsumae. In the 14th century, the place name Matômainu [万堂宇満伊犬] was 
recorded. From the 13th to 15th centuries, the Andô clan from Tsugaru traded 
with the Ainu. In 1457, Koshamain's War occurred. Koshamain was a chief of 
the Ainu. In the war, the Ainu forces destroyed 10 out of 12 forts, which were 
built by the Andô clan and were located in what is now south Hokkaidô (see 
Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the old forts). #3
   During the Edo era, Matsumae was the capital of the Matsumae Domain. It was 
the northernmost castle town in Japan. The ports of Matsumae, Esashi, and 
Hakodate were gateways to Ezo. ``Matsmai'' in Moby Dick (a novel) refers to 
Hokkaidô.
   In the end of the Edo era, in 1868, during the Boshin War, the Matsumae 
Domain separated the Tokugawa Shogunate and supported the new Meiji government. 
In the beginning of the Meiji period, still during the Boshin War, the former 
Tokugawa Shogunate forces took Fukuyama Castle (Matsumae Castle). In 1869 
(Meiji 2), the Meiji government forces recaptured Fukuyama Castle and advanced 
to Hakodate, where the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces stayed, and brought the 
war to an end. 
   After the Boshin war, the Matsumae Domain was renamed the Tate Domain. It 
was named after Tate Castle in Assabu (see Hakodate City in Oshima sub-
prefecture for Boshin War, see Assabu Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for Tate 
Castle). In 1871 (Meiji 4), the Tate Domain was abolished and Aomori Prefecture 
governed the southern part of Hokkaidô. In 1872 (Meiji 5), Matsumae office of 
the Hokkaidô Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi) was established. In 1881 
(Meiji 14), an administrative office of Matsumae county (Gun-yakusho) was 
established, and Matsumae office of the Hokkaidô Development Commission was 
abolished. In 1897 (Meiji 30), Matsumae sub-prefecture was established, and the 
administrative office of Matsumae county was abolished. In 1900 (Meiji 33), 
Fukuyama [福山] Town (1st-class municipality) was established. At that time, 34 
towns in the built-up area, which were continued from the Edo era, were merged. 
In 1903 (Meiji 36), Matsumae sub-prefecture were merged by Hakodate sub-
prefecture. #4
   In 1915 (Taishô 4), Ôshima [大島] Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established by the merger of three villages;  Eramachi [江良町], Haraguchi 
[原口], and Kiyobe [清部] (Ôshima village was not in Ôshima island). In 1923 
(Taishô 12), Kojima [小島] Village (2nd-class municipality) was established by 
the merger of five villages; Nebuta [根部田], Akagami [赤神], Satsumae [札前], 
Mogusa [茂草], and Utari [雨垂] (Kojima village was not in Kojima island). 
In the year, Ôsawa [大沢] Village (2nd-class municipality) was established by 
the merger of four villeges; Ôsawa, Araya [荒谷], Sumiyakizawa [炭焼沢], and 
Kamioyobe [上及部]. In 1940 (Shôwa 15), the name Fukuyama Town was changed to 
Matsumae Town. In 1954 (Shôwa 29), Matsumae Town merged the villages of Ôshima, 
Kojima, and Ôsawa. #5
   Matsume's town hall and Matsumae Castle (Fukuyama Castle) are located near 
the mouth of the Ômatsumae River. National Route 228 (Fukuyama-kaidô or 
Matsumae-kokudô) passes there. ``Fukuyama-kaidô'' was the trail that connected 
Matsumae and Hakodate in the Edo era (see Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-
prefecture for Fukuyama-kaidô). In the past, Matsumae Station was the terminal 
of the Matsumae Line, which ran between Matsumae and Kikonai. The population 
peaked at 20,072 in 1955. #6 #7
   Distinctive industries of Matsumae are fishery, food processing (mainly 
Surume and Matsumae-zuke), and sightseeing. FARMING --> fodder 192 hectares in 
2015, pasture 154, paddy rice X (concealed); and dairy cows - (zero). FISHERY
--> squid (flying squid 540 tons in 2017, other squid 154), snow crabs 442, 
akta mackerel 334, sea urchins 126, tuna 92, Pacific cod 61, Konbu kelp 57 
(cultured), octopus 49, sharks 47, olive flounder 6, shrimp/prawns 5, walleye 
pollock 4, abalone 2 (cultured), yellowtail 1, herring -, other fish 29+X, and 
other marine animals 11. #8
   As for sightseeing, Matsumae Castle is famous for cherry blossoms. There is 
a botanical garden with 10,000 cherry trees of 250 varieties. Because Matsumae 
was a castle town, there are many temples. Tourists can enjoy the temple's 
Japanese architecture and gardens. In the past, monks were like today's civil 
servants because they could read and write, so there are many temples in 
castle towns. #9

   #1 The southernmost point of Hokkaidô island is Cape Shirakami along 
National Route 228 (41° 23.87' North, 140° 11.86' East). Including small 
islands, the southernmost point is Kojima island. The island is also called 
Matsumae Kojima or Oshima Kojima. It is an uninhabited island.
   Ôshima island is the largest uninhabited island (9.7 km2) in the country. 
The island is also called Matsumae Ôshima or Oshima Ôshima. The island erupted 
in 1741 and the resulting tidal wave killed 2033 people in the Matsumae Domain 
(which ruled what is now south part of Hokkaidô) and the Tsugaru Domain (which 
ruled what is now west part of Aomori Prefecture).
   Today, in Ôshima and Kojima islands, there are shelters for fishing boats 
but tourists are not allowed to land. These islands are breeding grounds of 
seabirds such as Umigarasu (murre) and Ômizunagi-dori (Ostreaked shearwater). 
   #2 As for the Tsugaru Strait, the distance between Cape Shirakami in 
Matsumae Town and Cape Tappizaki in Sotogahama Town, Aomori Prefecture, is 
19.5 km. The distance between Cape Shiokubi in the former Toi Town (now 
Hakodate City) and Cape Ôma in Ôma Town, Aomori Prefecture, is 19.0 km. The 
water is longer but shallower in the west (Matsumae and Sotogahama) than 
the east (Hakodate and Ôma), so the undersea Seikan Tunnel was constructed in 
the west (see the note of Hakaodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the 
Tsugaru Strait).  
   #3 Koshamain's War was ended by Nobuhiro Takeda (see Kaminokuni Town in 
Hiyama for Nobuhiro Takeda). Suehiro Kakizaki, who was the great-grandson of 
Nobuhiro Takeda, made peace with Ainu schiefs around 1549. Yoshihiro Kakizaki, 
who was the son of Suehiro Kakizaki, became independent from the Andô clan in 
1593. That was because; Yoshihiro Kakizaki was able to ask Hideyoshi Toyotomi 
(the ruler of Japan at the time) for the land of Ezo (now Hokkaidô). The 
meeting was successful through the mediation of the Maeda clan (the ruler of 
the Kaga Domain, today's Ishikawa Prefecture). 
   In 1599, after the death of Hideyoshi Toyotomi, Yoshihiro Kakizaki gave the 
map of Ezo to Ieyasu Tokugawa (the founder of the Tokugawa Shogunate). Maps
were very important for ruling the land during the Warring States era. Giving 
the map meant obedience. In 1604, in the Edo era, the Tokugawa Shogunate 
appointed Yoshihiro Kakizaki as the lord of the Matsumae Domain, and he 
changed his family name from Kakizaki to Matsumae. So, there is a legend that 
the place name Matsumae is related to Matsudaira (Tokugawa's family name) and 
Maeda.
   #4 As for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities, in Hokkaidô, 1st-class 
(Ikkyû) and 2nd-class (Nikyû) municipalities were designated from 1899 to 1943. 
The Hokkaidô government subsidized 2nd-class municipalities. It was a 
pioneering period.
   #5 Sei Itô, a novelist, was born in Sumiyakizawa village. His novels were 
influenced by James Joyce, an Irish novelist, who published novels in English 
(not Celtic) and died in Zürich (see Otaru City in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture 
for Sei Itô).
   #6 As for Fukuyama Castle (Matsumae Castle), it was a national treasure of 
Japan, but it was burned down in 1949. Today, the only national treasure in 
Hokkaidô is a clay figurine that was dug from a potato field (see Hakodate City 
in Oshima sub-prefecture).
   #7 Matsumae Town is a sister city with Ômi-hachiman City in Shiga Prefecture
and Yanagawa Town (now Date City) in Fukushima Prefecture. The reasons date 
back to the Edo era; Hachiman-shônin (merchants from today's Ômi-hachiman City) 
traded in Ezo by Kitamae-bune (northern-bound ships). They based in the 
Matsumae's castle town and developed herring fishing grounds. 
   Regarding the relationsihp between Matsumae and Yanagawa, in 1807, the 
Tokugawa Shogunate directly ruled Ezo to prevent Russian southward movement. 
The Matsumae Domain's vassals were forced to moved to Yanagawa. Half of them 
became rônin (jobless samurai) and lived in hardship for 14 years until the 
Matsumae Domain was returned to Ezo in 1821.
   #8 As for fishery in Matsumae, Surume is famous. Surume is dried flying 
squid. Matsumae and Fukushima towns are the largest producers of dried flying 
squid in the country. Their tonnages account for 80% of the national share. In 
the late Meiji period, herring fishing decreased and flying squid fishing 
prospered. Dried flying squid (Surme) was processed by fishers until the 1970s. 
Today, it is processed by local companies (by Matsumae Town's website ``History 
of Matsumae Surume,'' last accessed May 2019).
   Matsumae-zuke is pickles made with Konbu kelp, dried flying squid, and 
herring roe. A variety of Matsumae-zuke are sold at the souvenir shop ``Dosanko 
Plaza'' in Sapporo Station. In the past, when herring catches were poor, 
Matsumae-zuke without herring roe was sold.
   #9 These are famous cherry blossom sites in Hokkaidô; Matsumae Castle, 
Goryôkaku Castle (Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture), rows of cherry trees 
leading to Noboribetsu Hot Spring (Noboribetsu City in Iburi sub-prefecture), 
Nijikken Road in Shizunai (now Shin-hidaka Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture), and 
Shiokari Pass (Wassamu Town in Kamikawa sub-prefecture). 
  The main varieties of cherry are; Yaezakura (double-flowered cherry) and many 
other ones including Somei-yoshino in Matsmae Castle; Somei-yoshino in 
Goryôkaku Castle; and Ezo-yamazakura (mountain cherry) in Shizunai. The best 
time to see cherry blossoms varies year by year, but generally, it is from late 
April to mid May in Matsumae Town and from early to mid May in Shizunai Town.
   Somei-yoshino is the most famous cherry variety in the country. It was bred 
in Somei village near Edo in the end of the Edo era. The village was located 
near Ikebukuro, Tokyo. Somei-yoshino was named after Mt. Yoshino, a famous 
cherry blossom site in Nara Prefecture. One of the oldest Somei-yoshino tree 
in the country grows at Matsumae Castle. It was planted in 1882 (Meiji 15). 
   Trees of Somei-yoshino are clones. If the soil and climate are the same, 
they grow in the same way. So, they are used as an indicator of cherry blossom 
blooming time. Making plant clones are easier than animal clones. Clones are 
more alike than siblings. Plant clones are the predecessors of today's digital 
society.

AREA 187 KM2 (2010), FOREST 173, CULTIVATED 0; MATSUMAE COUNTY [松前郡]; POP 
5114 (2010), 8111 (1990); COUNTRY SIGN --> SQUID.

Fukushima [fu-ku-shi-ma 福島] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, south 
Hokkaidô (Dô-nan). The area faces the Tsugaru Strait to the south. The rivers 
of Fukushima and Shiriuchi flow. Mt. Daisengen (1072 m) rises to the north. 
Forests cover 93% of the area. Matsumae county, which consist of Fukushima Town 
and Matsumae Town, is located in the southern end of Hokkaidô.
   The name Fukushima (fuku-shima) is Japanese. It means ``lucky, island.'' It 
is an good-luck name given by the oracle of Tsukizaki Shrine in 1624. #1 #2
   The first Japanese immigrants to Ezo (now Hokkaidô) came from Ôshû (now 
Tôhoku region) in 1189. They were vassals of the Fujiwara clan that were 
defeated by Yoritomo Minamoto, who was the founder of the Kamakura Shogunate 
after the conquest of Ôshû. The first immigrants lived in what is now Yoshioka 
district in Fukushima Town. In the mid-15th century, there was Onnai-date (a 
fort) in Yoshioka district. It was destroyed by the Ainu forces during 
Koshamain's War (see Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the war). In 
the Edo era, the area was ruled by the Matsumae Domain. Around 1617, a gold 
mine was opened in Mt. Daisengen. Catholic gold miners gathered on the 
mountain. #3
   In the beginning of the Meiji period, the area belonged to the Tate Domain 
(it was renamed from the Matsumae Domain, see Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-
prefecture). In 1879 (Meiji 12), two administrative office (Kochô-yakuba) were 
established; one was for Fukushima and Shirafu [白符] villages and the other 
was for Yoshioka [吉岡], Reihige [礼髭], and Miyanouta [宮歌] villages. In 1900 
(Meiji 33), Fukushima Village (1st-class municipality) was established 
(Fukushima and Shirafu were merged). In 1902 (Meiji 35), Yoshioka Village (2nd-
class municipality) was established (Yoshioka, Reihige, and Miyanouta were 
merged). In 1944 (Shôwa 19), Fukushima Town was established. In 1955 (Shôwa 
30), Fukushima Town merged Yoshioka Village (see the note of Matsumae Town in 
Oshima sub-prefecture for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities).
   Fukushima's town hall and the center of the town are located near the mouth 
of the Fukushima River. National Route 228 (Fukuyama-kaidô) runs there. 
Previously, the Matsumae Line ran along the national highway. The railway 
connected Matsumae Station in Matsumae Town and Kikonai Station in Kikonai 
Town. On the Kaikyô Line, there was Yoshioka-kaitei Station, which was an 
undersea station of the Seikan Tunnel. #4 #5
   Distinctive industries of Fukushima are fishery and forestry. FAMING --> 
paddy rice X (concealed) in 2015; dairy cows - (zero) in 2015. FISHERY --> 
squid (flying squid 895 tons in 2017, other squid 26), sea urchins 85, tuna 66, 
octopus 48, seaweed (Konbu kelp 24, other seaweed 10), olive flounder 6, 
trout 6, akta mackerel 6, right-eye flounder 1, abalone 1, herring 0, other 
fish 10, and other marine animals 3.
   Fishing ports are located in Fukushima, Yoshioka, Shirafu, and Urawa. About 
80% of the catch is squid. Fukushima and Matsumae towns are the leading 
producers of Surume (dried flying squid) in the country (see Matsumae Town in 
Oshima sub-prefecture for Surume production). As for forestry, the main trees 
are cedar, fir (Todomatsu), and spruce (Ezomatsu). The ceder is sold as the 
brandmark Dô-nan-sugi (South Hokkaidô Cedar). #6
   As for sightseeing, there are Seikan Tunnel Memorial Hall, Inô Tadataka 
Hokkaidô Survey Memorial Park, and Yokozuna Chiyo-no-Yama and Chiyo-no-Fuji 
Memorial Hall (Yokozuna are champions of Sumô wrestling). The country sign 
(gateway sign) of the town is a squid Sumô wrestler. The name of the road-side 
station is ``Yokozuna-no-sato (the hometown of Sumô champions).''

   #1 According to ``Fukushima-chô-shi (Fukushima Town history),'' once upon a 
time, Orikanai village was on the verge of being abandoned, because of a large 
fire and poor fishing. At the time, an oracle from Tsukisaki Shrine said; 
The name Orikanai should be changed to Fukushima.
   The naming relates to Fukuyama, which was the neighbouring castle town 
(today's Matsumae Town). Fuku-yama in Japanese means ``lucky, mountain'' and
Fuku-shima means ``lucky, island.
   The old name Orikanai came from the Ainu word horka-nay (reverse, river). It 
meant the Fukushima River. Seawater entered the estuary at high tide. This 
meaning is the same as Horokanai Town in Kamikawa sub-prefecture. 
   #2 These are old shrines in Fukushima; Tsukisaki Shrine (reconstructed in 
1492), Fukushima Daijingû Shrine (reconstructed in 1573), Shirafu Daijingû 
Shrine (established by the Matsumae Domain in 1655), and Kamaya Shrine 
(established in 1772). 
   The Shirafu Arauma Odori (an old dance) of Shirafu Daijingû Shrine has been 
designated as a national cultural heritage. The dance represents the power of 
the Matsumae Domain. Kamaya Shrine is located in Shiogama district. Shio-gama 
in Japanese means ``salt, pot.'' The name came from salt production for sardine 
fishing.
   #3 Mt. Dai-sen-gen in Japanese and means ``large, 1000 houses.'' It 
signified the 1000 houses of gold miners. During the Edo era, the Tokugawa 
Shogunate banned Christianity, however, the regulation was loose in Ezo island, 
because the place was seen as an outer land (Gaichi). 
   In 1637, Christians revolted in Kyûshû island. That led to the execution of 
Christians in Ezo island in 1639. At the site of the gold mine, there is an 
inscription that reads ``Christian Martyrdom.''
   #4 As for Fukuyama-kaidô, ``Fukuyama'' refers the former Matsumae Town. The 
Fukuyama-kaidô was an old trail that connected Fukuyama Castle (Matsume 
Castle) and Hakodate. The Matsumae Domain's samurais walked the distance of 
about 100km. Cf. Matsumae-kaidô was located in Tsugaru, now Aomori Prefecture 
(see the note of Hokuto City in Oshima sub-prefecture for Matsumae-kaidô).
   #5 The Seikan Tunnel is a railway tunnel. Its length is 54 kilometers. Cf. 
Channel Tunnel/Le tunnel sous la Mance is 50 kilometers and Gotthard Base 
Tunnel in Switzerland is 57 kilometers.
    Yoshioka-kaitei Station in Fukushima Town was built at 150 meters under the 
sea. The purpose was for under-sea tunnel maintenance and sightseeing. 
Yoshioka-kaitei Station was closed in 2006 and demolished in 2014. 
   Yoshioka district in Fukushima Town was the base for the construction of 
Seikan Tunnel. The undersea tunnel was constructed from 1961 to 1988. Yoshioka 
district was flourished during the period of construction (see Kikonai Town and 
Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the undersea tunnel).
   #6 Cedar ['si-dar] trees are not common in Hokkaidô, so cedar pollen fever 
is rare, however, white birch and alder cause pollen fever. I did not hear 
about pollen fever when I was a child in the 1970s. The cedar forests in Japan 
were still young at the time. Cedars grow even on wet land, so they were 
planted on abandoned rice paddies near valley heads during the high economic 
growth period.

AREA 197 KM2 (2010), FOREST 172, CULTIVATED 13; KAMIISO COUNTY [上磯郡]; POP 
5074 (2010), 6383 (1990); COUNTRY SIGN --> SHINKANSEN, OYSTER, & NIRA GIRL.

Shiriuchi [shi-ri-u-chi 知内] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, south 
Hokkaidô (Dô-nan). It is located in the southwest of the Oshima Peninsula. The 
part is also called Matsumae Peninsula. The area of Shiriuchi faces the Tsugaru 
Strait to the east. Forests cover 87% of the area.
   The name Shiriuchi came from the Ainu word cir-ot-i (bird, exist, place). It 
signified the Shiriuchi River. In the Edo era, Shiriuchi was a hunting ground 
for hawks and falcons. Young hawks and falcons were caught and shipped to Edo 
(now Tokyo) for falconry. #1
   In 1205, gold dust gathering started along the Shiriuchi River. It was 
operated by the feudal lord of Kai Province (now Yamanashi Prefecture) by order 
of the Kamakura Shogunate. In the 15th century, there was a fort called 
Wakimoto-date [da-te]. It was one of the 12 forts that were built by the Andô 
clan from Tsugaru (now Aomori Prefecture). During the Edo era, the area was 
ruled by the Matsumae Domain. #2
   After the Meiji period, an administrative office (Kochô-yakuba) was 
established in 1871 (Meiji 4). It was a continuation of village headman from 
the Edo era. In 1881 (Meiji 14), an administrative office (Kochô-yakuba) 
of Shiriuchi was established. It also included Kotaniishi [小谷石] village (by 
``Shin-Shiriuchi-chôshi (new Shiriuchi Town history)'' published in 2015). In 
1906 (Meiji 39), Shiriuchi Village (2nd-class municipality) was established by 
the merger of Shiriuchi and Kotaniishi villages. In 1967 (Shôwa 42), Shiriuchi 
Town was established.
   Shiriuchi's town hall and the center of the town are located near the mouth 
of the Shiriuchi River. National Route 228 (Fukuyama-kaidô) crosses the 
Shiriuchi River (``Fukuyama'' means the castle town of the Matsumae Domain or 
the name of the former Matsumae Town). The national highway runs along the 
coast, goes inland from the center of the town, and leads to Fukushima Town. 
Previously, the Matsumae Line of Japanese National Railways ran along the 
national highway. There was also Shiriuchi Station on the Kaikyô Line. The 
station became a roadside station (Michi-no-eki). Visitors can watch the 
Shinkansen coming out of the undersea tunnel. #3 #4
   Distinctive industries of Shiriuchi are agriculture, fishery, forestry, and 
power generation. FARMING --> paddy rice 422 hectares in 2015, soybeans 124, 
buckwheat 85, pasture 54, fodder 18, spinach 14, wheat 3, potatoes 2, 
orchards 1, flowers 1, other vegetables 95+X (including Nira (Chinese chive or 
gynmigit)); and dairy cows 112 head in 2015. FISHERY --> squid (flying squid 
296 tons in 2017, other squid 20), salmon 66, sea urchins 30, seaweed 13 (Konbu 
kelp), shellfish 11 (oysters), olive flounder 10, right-eye flounder 6 (marbled 
flounder), octopus 5, anchovy 4, yellowtail 4, sharks 1, mackerel 1, herring 0, 
other fish 20, and other marine animals 3.
   According to agricultural regionalization, the town was classified as 
``small-scale and single-crop production of paddy rice'' area. Today, Shiriuchi 
is the largest producer of Nira in Hokkaidô. Nira is cultivated in greenhouses 
and harvested from January to October. #5 #6

   #1 As for the name Shiriuchi (bird, exist, place in Ainu), in the Edo era, 
the Matsumae Domain traded hawks and falcons (Taka and Hayabusa in Japanese). 
Among bird-catching places in Ezo (old Hokkaidô), Shiriuchi was one of the 
best. Taka-machi (hawk catchers) searched nests in summer. They wintered in 
Ezo, caught chicks of hawks in spring, and sent them to the Tokugawa Shogunate. 
Hawk feathers were also traded because they were used as arrow fletchings.
   The Ainu also caught hawks by hooking their legs. They hid in a hut nearby a 
stream and used salmon to lure hawks. They sold hawks to the Japanese. They 
also kept hawks to take feathers. Cf. The Ainu also had young bears (see bear 
ranch in Noboribetsu City, Iburi sub-prefecture).
   #2 Shiriuchi Town has a long history of Japanese immigrants. Wakimoto Shrine 
in Kitsune-goshi district was established in 1239. Raikô Shrine in the center 
of the town was established in 1244. Shiriuchi Hot Spring was discovered by 
gold miners in 1247. These are very old ones in Hokkaidô.
   The fort Wakimoto-date was located in Wakimoto district near Cape Kitsune-
goshi. The fort was destroyed by Ainu forces during Koshamain's War (see 
Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the war).
   #3 In Fukushima Town, the road along the sea is a dead end. To the west of 
Cape Kitsunegoshi, there is Kotaniishi district. To the west of Kotaniishi 
district, there is Cape Yagoshi. The cape is a sea cliff of 121 meter high and 
has no footpath. Yagoshi in Japanese means ``arrow, pass,'' and Kitusnegoshi 
means ``fox, pass.''
   #4 In the observatory of Siriuchi Roadside Station, there is a time table of 
the Shinkansen trains entering and leaving the undersea tunnel (Seikan Tunnel). 
Part of the former Shiriuchi Station on the Kaikyô Line became Yu-no-sato 
Signal Station. Thie station is the end of the undersea tunnel.
   On the former Matsumae Line, there was Yu-no-sato Station. Yu-no-sato in 
Japanese means ``village of hot spring.'' It is a place name along the 
Shiriuchi River. Shiriuchi Hot Spring is located there (see Kikonai Town in 
Oshima sub-prefecture for the Kaikyô Line).
   #5 As for fishery in Shiriuchi, oysters are cultivated in the open sea. It 
is a unique method, because oysters are typically farmed along coastlines. 
Shiriuchi's oysters are advertised at tasting events in Susukino, the largest 
entertainment distirct in Sapporo (it is also the largest entertainment 
district in Hokkaidô). 
   As for power generation, Shiriuchi Power Plant by Hokkaidô Electric Power 
Company is located in Motomachi district to the south. The power station uses 
heavy oil and Orimulsion (a new fuel). In summer, the company sells electricity 
to Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tokyo metropolitan area consumes a huge amount 
of electricity during the hot summer). The electricity is sold using the power 
line inside the Seikan Tunnel. The undersea power line is a direct electric 
current, which is suitable for high voltage and long-distance transmission.
   #6 As for tourism, Shiriuchi is the hometown of Saburô Kitajima, who is a 
famous Enka singer (Enka is a traditional style Japanese music). There is 
Kitajima Memorial Hall in Hakodate City. Incidentally, when I guided a field 
excursion in Tokyo, I happened to pass by his residence. It was near the site 
of another Enka singer's residence. Young students did not know two of them. 
This is one of Kitajima's famous songs; Yosaku-wa-ki-wo-kiru, hey hey hoo 
(Yosaku cuts trees, hey hey hoo). When I hear this song, I remember the 
forestry office (Eirin-sho) of Hokkaidô.

Kikonai [ki-ko-na-i 木古内] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, south Hokkaidô 
(Dô-nan). It is located in the southwestern part of the Oshima Peninsula. The 
part is also called Matsumae Peninsula. The area of Kikonai faces the Tsugaru 
Strait. Forests cover 88% of the area.
   The name Kikonai came from the Ainu word rir-o-nay (tide, enter, stream). It 
meant the Kikonai River. Saltwater entered the estuary of the river at high 
tide.
   In the 15th century, Nakano-date (a fort) was built. It was one of 12 forts 
in Ezo (old Hokkaidô) (see Kaminokuni Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the 
forts). In the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain ruled the area. The name Kikonai 
appears on the map of Ezo that was drawn by the Matsumae Domain in 1624.
   After the Meiji period, an administrative office (Kochô-yakuba) was 
established in 1879 (Meiji 12). Kikonai Village (2nd-class municipality) was
established in 1902 (Meiji 35). At the time, the villages of Kikonai, Kamatani 
[釜谷], Izumisawa [泉沢], Sakkari [札苅] were merged. In 1919 (Taishô 8), 
Kikonai Village (1st-class municipality) was established. In 1942 (Shôwa 17), 
Kikonai Town was established (see the note of Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-
prefecture for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities). #1 #2
   Kikonai's town hall and the center of the town are located near the mouth of 
the Kikonai River. National Route 228 (Fukuyama-kaidô) runs through the center 
of the town. Kikonai Station on the Hokkaidô Shinkansen is the terminal of the 
Isaribi Railway. Isaribi in Japanese means ``fishing lamp.'' The lamps are 
for squid fishing and floating on the sea from June to December (see Hakodate  
City and Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for squid fishing). In the 
past, the Esashi Line and the Matsumae Line ran. 
   Kikonai was a transportation hub in the Matsumae Peninsula. Governmental 
offices were located in the center of the town such as a summary court, a 
forestry agency, and a railway yard by Japanese National Railways. Woodworking 
factories were also located near the station (incidentally, old television sets 
were made from wooden planks). #3
   Distinctive industries of Kikonai are fishery, agriculture, animal husbandry 
(including Hakodate Wagyû Beef), and forestry (including Dônan Ceder). FARMING 
--> paddy rice 291 hectares in 2015, pasture 188, fodder 26, orchards 5, 
potatoes 4, spinach 2, soybeans 1, radishes 1, yams 1; dairy cows 291 head in 
2015, and beef cattle X (concealed). FISHERY --> salmon 65 tons in 2017 (autumn 
salmon), sea urchines 22, seaweed 18 (Konbu, Wakame, and Iwa-nori kelps), 
shellfish (abalone 1, other shellfish 10), olive flounder 14, right-eye 
flounder 9 (marbled flounder), octopus 8, mackerel 5, sharks 4, yellowtail 1, 
Pacific cod 1, herring 0, other fish 7, and other marine animals 6. #4
   The country sign (gateway sign) of Kikonai signifies Kanchû-misogi, which 
means ``winter, purification'' in Japanese. It is a festival that started in 
1831. During the festival, people go into the sea in the middle of winter (the 
sea is warmer than rivers and lakes in winter, but the location is Hokkaidô).

   #1 As for the Boshin War, the battle of Kikonai happened in 1869 (Meiji 2).
The Meiji government forces advanced from Esashi to Hakodate, and the former 
Tokugawa Shogunate forces counter-attacked. One of the routes taken by the 
Meiji government forces was the Kikonai Mountain Trail (see Hakodate City in 
Oshima sub-prefecture for the Boshin War). 
   #2 In 1871 (Meiji 4), Kanrin-maru (ship) sank at Cape Saraki in Kikonai. The 
ship's anchor is displayed in the town museum of Kikonai. There is a monument 
to the ship along National Route 228. 
   Kanrin-maru was a battleship that the Tokugawa Shogunate purchased from the 
Netherlands. It was the first Japanese ship that crossed the Pacific Ocean. 
   In 1860, to complete the conclusion of the Japan-US Treaty of Amity and 
Commerce, Kanrin-maru departed from the Port of Shinagawa on January 13th and 
arrived in the Port of San Francisco on February 26th. The captain was Kaishû 
Katsu and the interpreter was Manjirô John. On the outbound voyage, bad weather 
caused the Japanese crew to become sea-sick and the Americans took over 
piloting.
   In 1867, the ship's steam was removed. It became a cargo ship. After the 
Meiji period, the new government owned the ship and it sank in a heavy storm 
in September 1871.
   #3 JR Hokkaidô's Hokkaidô Shinkansen opened in 2016, and a section of the 
Esashi Line between Goryôkaku Station in Hakodate City and Kikonai Station in 
Kikonai Town changed to the Isaribi Railway (South Hokkaidô  Railway). The 
former Esashi Line ran along the Tsugaru Strait, entered the mountains from 
Kikonai Town, and went to Esashi Town in the sea of Japan side. 
   In 2012, Kikonai High School was closed. In 2014, a section between Kikonai 
Station and Esahi Station on the Esashi Line closed (high school students are 
the main customers of local railways). Part of the railway was converted to a 
trolley line for sightseeing.
   Kikonai Station is also the terminal of the Kaikyô Line. The Kakyô line 
runs through the undersea Seikan Tunnel. After the Hokkaidô Shinkansen opened, 
only freight trains and special trains for group tours use the Kaikyô Line. The
Shinkansen also uses the same undersea tunnel, but the Shinkanse is not the 
Kaikyô line. 
   The track gauge (distance between two rails) is different between the 
Shinkansen and conventional railways including the Kaikyô Line. The Seikan 
Tunnel was made as a dual-gauge (three rails) and double-truck railway (see 
Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the undersea tunnel). 
   The former Matsumae Line connected Kikonai Station and Matsumae Station. It 
was abolished in 1988. It was two years after the privatization of JNR 
(Japanese National Railways). There used to be many railways and their branch 
routes in Hokkaidô. This is because many local politicians promised many 
railways.
   #4 As for dairy farming in Kikonai, in 1897 (Meiji 30), a milk collection 
facility was built. Horse-drawn carriage shipped raw milk to Tôbetsu Trappist 
Monastery. In 1919 (Taishô 8), condensed milk butter was produced too. (See 
Hokuto City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the monastery; See Eniwa City in 
Ishikari sub-prefecture for dairy farming).

Hokuto [ho-ku-to 北斗] is a city in Oshima sub-prefecture, south Hokkaidô (Dô-
nan). It faces Hakodate Bay and the Tsugaru Strait. The rivers of Moheji, Ôno, 
and Kunebetsu flow.
   The name Hokuto is Japanese. It means the Big Dipper that shines in the 
north sky. It was named by public offering when Kamiiso [上磯] and Ôno [大野] 
towns were merged in 2006. #1
   In the mid 15th century, Mobetsu-date [da-te] (a fort) was built near the 
mouth of the Moheji River (see Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for old 
forts in south Hokkaidô). In the Edo era, the area was ruled by the Matsumae 
Domain. 
   After the Meiji period, in 1880 (Meiji 13), administrative offices (Kochô-
yakuba) were established in Kamiiso and Ôno villages. In 1885 (Meiji 18), an 
administrative office was established in Moheji [茂辺地] village. In 1900 
(Meiji 33), Kamiiso Village (1st-class municipality) and Ôno Village (1st-class 
municipality) were established. In 1906 (Meiji 39), Mobetsu [茂別] Village 
(2nd-class municipality) was established by the merger of Moheji and Ishibetsu 
[石別] villages. In 1918 (Taishô 7), Kamiiso Town was established. In 1955 
(Shôwa 30), Kamiiso Town merged Mobetsu Village. In 1957 (Shôwa 32), Ôno Town 
was established (see the note of Matsumae in Oshima for 1st-class and 2nd-class 
municipalities).
   Hokuto's city hall is located near the mouth of the Ôno River. It used to be 
Kamiiso's town hall. National Route 228 (Fukuyama-kaidô) and the Dônan Isaribi 
Railway run the center of the city (see Kikonai Town in Oshima sub-prefecture 
for the Dônan Isaribi Railway; see Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 
Fukuyama-kaidô). 
   To the south, residential, commercial, and manufacturing areas extend from 
the center of Hakodate City. To the north, National Route 227 (Ôno-kokudô) runs 
through the Ôno Plain and crosses the ridge to Esashi Town. Shin-hakodate-
hokuto Station on the Hokkaidô Shinkansen is located near the border with Nanae 
Town. It used to be Oshima-Ôno Station on the Hakodate Main Line. The 
population of Hokuto City increased. #2
   Distinctive industries of Hokuto are manufacturing, agriculture, and 
fishery. FARMING --> paddy rice 1198 hectares in 2015, fodder 659, beans 
(soybeans 239, adzuki beans 9, other beans 5), green onions 131, pasture 110, 
radishes 57, tomatoes 50, potatoes 39, spinach 37, cabbage 28, Chinese cabbage 
16, lettuce 14, cucumbers 14, orchards 11, strawberries 9, yams 6, flowers 4, 
onions 2, other vegetables 139+X, other grains 8, other fruits 1; and dairy 
cows 336 head in 2015. FISHERY --> salmon 387 tons in 2017, anchovy 242, 
yellowtail 88, shellfish (abalone 1, Manila clam 1, other shellfish 74), 
herring 51, right-eye flounder 37, Pacific cod 34, olive flounder 26, crabs 25, 
squid (flying squid 21, other squid 1), seaweed 21, sea urchins 15, mackerel 
13, octopus 11, trout 7, puffer fish 2, red seabream 1, other fish 44+X, and 
other marine animals 10.
   On satellite images, a straight line stretches to Hakodate Bay. It is a 
jetty of Taiheiyô Cement Kamiiso Factory. The limestone deposit of the cement 
industry was discovered in 1872 by Benjamin Smith Lyman, an American mining 
scholar invited by the Meiji government. As for agriculture, paddy rice 
cultivation started in Ôno in the late 17th century. It was the first rice 
cultivation record in Hokkaidô. As for sightseeing, the old building printed 
in the country sign (gateway sign) is Tôbetsu Trappist Monastery. It is located 
to the west, near the border with Kikonai Town. The monastery is famous for its 
old red brick buildings and tree-lined avenues. #3 #4 #5

   #1 As for the history of Hokuto City, the former Kamiiso Town was located 
along Hakodate Bay. The name was derived from Kamiiso county, which was 
established in 1869 (Meiji 2). The county's name was suggestion by Takeshirô 
Matsuura. Kami-iso in Japanese means ``upper, coast.'' ``Upper'' refers to the 
west, where the castle of the Matsumae Domain was located. Or, it was derived 
from the old Kamiiso-kaidô (trail), which was another name for the Matsumae-
kaidô in Tsugaru (now Aomori Prefecture). The Matsumae-kaidô connected Abura-
kawa (in today's Aomori City) and Min-maya (in today's Sotoga-hama Town, Aomori 
Prefecture). 
   In the Edo era, there were villages of Arikawa [有川] and Hekirichi [戸切地] 
in today's Kamiiso district. The former Ôno Town was located inland. Ô-no is 
Japanese and means ``large, plain.'' It is an old name that was documented in 
the Gôchô [郷帳] (village record) written in 1700 (Edo era).
   #2 As for the landscape of Hokuto City, when I was traveling on Fukuyama-
kaidô (National Route 228), I saw many concrete wave-breaking blocks along the 
coast. Hokuto City is one of the largest cement producing municipalities in 
Japan (Cement is a material of concrete).
   Wave-breaking blocks are known as Tetrapod in Japan. It was the patent of 
Neyrpic (a French company). I heard like this from Professor Sunamura at 
University of Tsukuba (HTTP://2242.MOOO.COM/POSI/95IZU/1452-950303.JPG); When 
Neyrpic executives visited Japan, they saw many fake Tetrapods along the coast. 
Then, Nippon Tetrapod Co. (a branch of Neyrpic) was established in 1961. The 
fake Tetrapods had hooks for lifting, so they were easy to install, however, 
they were less durable than the original ones because the hooks would rust and 
corrode.
   #3 As for the cement industry of Hokuto City, Taiheiyô Cement extracts 
limestone at Garô Mine. The cement is transported to the pier via two 
kilometers' jetty. The original cement factory was established in 1884 (Meiji 
17). It became Hokaidô Cement in 1890 (Meiji 23). It was purchased by Asano 
Cement in 1915 (Taishô 4). 
   After World War II, Asano zaibatsu (conglomerates) was dismantled and Asano 
Cement changed the name to Nihon Cement. In 1988 (Shôwa 63), by the merger of 
Nihon Cement and Chichibu Onoda Cement, Taiheiyô Cement was established. 
   Limestone is the self-sufficient resource of Japan. Today, almost all 
electricity poles are made of cement. The oldest concrete electricity pole in 
the country is still used in Hakodate City. It was installed in 1923 (Taishô 
12) for fire prevention. Old electricity poles are attractive.
   #4 As for agriculture of Hokuto City, the former Ôno Town is the birth place 
of paddy rice cultivation in Hokkaidô. It started in the Edo era. There is a 
stone monument that commemorates the first paddy rice cultivation. The 
inscription reads; In 1692, a farmer Sakuemon opened a paddy filed of 450 tsubo 
(0.15 hectares) using natural water and gained rice of 10 hyô (600 kg). That 
record was excellent at the time (today, a good paddy field has a yield of 
600kg per 0.1 hectares. Such paddy is called jippyo-dori (10-hyou gaining)). 
   According to oral tradition, paddy rice was cultivated in the Kanbun period 
(1661-1672) and in 1685 in today's Ôno district in Hokuto City (by T. Hoshino 
ed. 1994 ``Hokkaidô-no-inasaku (Rice cultivation of Hokkaidô)'').
   Kametarô Ôtomo, an engineer in the end of the Edo era, instructed 
agriculture in Ôno village. Then, he moved to Sapporo in 1866 and constructed 
the Ôtomo Canal (today's Sôsei River). Kyûzô Nakayama, who is known as the 
father of cold-climate paddy rice cultivation, also obtained rice seeds in Ôno 
village (see Kita-hiroshima City in Ishikari sub-prefecture for cold-climate 
rice cultivation).
   #5 Tôbetsu Trappist Monastery in Hokuto City was established in 1896 (Meiji 
29). The monks started dairy farming. It later spread to the village of 
Kikonai. Today, the monastery sells butter, ice cream, and cookies. 
   A monastery is a place where monks live together. It is Catholic. It is also 
Catholic to have statues of Mary and saints, but they do not pray to them. In 
olden days, many people could not read, so they made statues. (Incidentally, 
today's university teachers use a lot of PowerPoint. The situation is like 
idolatry).

Hakodate [ha-ko-da-te 函館] is a city in Oshima sub-prefecture, south Hokkaidô 
(Dô-nan). The area occupies the southeast of the Oshima Peninsula. The part is 
called Kameda Peninsula. The area of Hakodate faces Hakodate Bay, Tsugaru 
Strait, and the Pacific Ocean. Mt. Hakodate stands from Hakodate Bay. The 
height is 334 meters (cf. Tokyo Tower is 333 meters). The area was newly formed 
in 2004 by the merger of Hakodate City, Toi Town, Minami-kayabe Town, Esan 
Town, and Todohokke Village. #1 #2 #3
   The name Hako-date means ``box, fort'' in Japanese. It referred to the shape 
of the fort Usukeshi-date. It was built by the Kôno clan in 1454, who migrated 
from Tsugaru (now Aomori Prefecture). The Kôno clan was one of the vassals of 
the Andô clan that built 12 forts in Ezo (old Hokaidô). During Koshamain's War, 
Usukeshi-date (so-called Hako-date) was destroyed by the Ainu forces (Koshamain 
was a chief of the Ainu. See Kaminokuni Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the 
Andô clan and Koshamain's War).
   In the Edo era, the Port of Hakodate was managed by the Matsumae Domain and 
later by the Tokugawa Shogunate. The port was opened for American ships in 1854 
under the Convention of Kanagawa (Japan-US Treaty of Peace and Amity). In the 
beginning of the Meiji period, Hakodate became the battle ground of the Boshin 
War (1868-1869). In 1869 (Meiji 2), the Hokkaidô Development Commission was 
established (the head office moved from Hakodate to Sapporo in 1871). In 1879 
(Meiji 12), Hakodate became a ward [区] (an administrative district). In 1899 
(Meiji 32), Hakodate Ward (a local government) was established (see Kushiro 
Town in Kushiro sub-prefecture for wards in Hokkaidô). In 1922 (Taishô 11), 
Hakodate City was established. In 1939 (Shôwa 14), Hakodate City merged 
Yunokawa Town [湯川町] (1st-class municipality, whose area was around Yunokawa 
Hot Spring). In 1966 (Shôwa 41), Hakodate City merged Zenigame-zawa Village 
[銭亀沢村] (the former 1st-class municipality, whose the area was around 
Hakodate Airport). In 1973 (Shôwa 48), Hakodate City merged Kameda City 
[亀田市] (see the note of Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 1st-class 
and 2nd-class municipalities). #4 #5 #6
   Hakodate's city hall and the Port of Hakodate are located near the foot of 
Mt. Hakodate. National Route 5 and the Hakodate Main Line start from the port.
Hakodate was the gateway of Hokkaidô from the late 19th century to the late 
20th century. In the past, Seikan train-ferries (Seikan-renraku-sen) connected 
cities of Aomori and Hakodate. The word Sei-kan in Japanese means Aomori and 
Hakodate. 
   Hakodate's population peaked in 1980 at 345,165 (including municipalities of 
Toi, Esan, Minami-kayabe, and Todohokke). The population decreased because of 
the end of pelagic fishing (deep-sea fishing), opening of the Seikan Tunnel, an 
increase in air travelers, and motorization. #7 #8
   Distinctive industries of Hakodate are sightseeing, fishery, fish 
processing, trade, and ship-building. FARMING --> potatoes 393 hectares in 
2015, pasture 260, paddy rice 73, cabbage 54, beans (adzuki beans 19, soybeans 
9, other beans 1), fodder 27, orchards 18, Chinese cabbage 16, green onions 10, 
flowers 8, broccoli 7, spinach 3, tomatoes 2, onions 1, cucumbers 1, other 
vegetables 47+X; and dairy cows 467 head in 2015. FISHERY --> squid (flying 
squid 5660 tons in 2017, other squid 377), walleye pollock 5162, sardines 4889, 
yellowtail 4045, anchovy 2414, mackerel 1717, seaweed (Konbu and Gagome-konbu 
kelp) 1463, salmon 1105, octopus 919, sea urchins 691, tuna 687, Pacific cod 
615, right-eye flounder 248, shellfish (abalone 3, other shellfish 237), sharks 
122, sand lance 119, trout 92, olive flounder 46, akta mackerel 38, horse 
mackerel 33, shrimp/prawns 27, herring 21, puffer fish 21, marine mammals 18, 
kichiji 14, crabs 4, bonito 2, Hatahata 1, other fish 571+X, and other marine 
animals 122. #9
   As for sightseeing, famous tourist destinations are Goryôkaku Castle, Mt. 
Hakodate, night view from Mt. Hakodate, old Western-style buildings, old 
churches in Motomachi district, brick warehouses on the old wharf, Ekini 
market, Yunokawa Hot Spring, and landscape of slopes (saka-michi) filmed in 
movies and TV dramas.
   Goryôkaku Castle was built inland to avoid artillery from ships. It was 
constructed between 1857 and 1866, after the Japan-US Treaty of Peace and 
Amity. It became the last castle of the Tokugawa Shogunate forces during the 
Boshin War and fell. Today, tourists enjoy climbing up an observation tower 
with a height of 100m in the castle. #10
   The Western-style buildings from the Meiji period has been preserved, e.g. 
Hokkaidô Government Hakodate Branch Office and Hakodate Ward Public Hall. They 
were constructed after the great fires in the Meiji period. At Ekini market, 
tourists can fish for squid. The market used to be a morning fair in front of 
Hakodate Station. #11 #12

   #1 Mt. Hakodate is also called Gagyû-san in Japanese. It means ``lying cow 
mountain,'' due to the shape. The top of the mountain was removed by 14 meters 
when a battery was built in the Meiji period. It is said that the nature of the 
mountain remains because people's access was restricted for the military 
facility that was resided from the Meiji to the Shôwa periods. Actually, 
however, native trees were cut for firewood and construction materials since 
the fort Hakodate was built in the 15th century. Today, cedar trees can be seen 
along the routes of bus and ropeway. Ceder trees have been cultivated since the 
Edo era (about 200 years ago).
   The night view from Mt. Hakodate is counted as one of World Top Three Night 
Views, along with Hong Kong and Naples. Sometimes, Nagasaki, which is also a 
port city, is counted instead of Hakodate. In any case, the top-three in the 
ranking were counted by the Japanese. In the past, the Japanese traveled around 
the world by ship. Japan was a maritime nation (see Kushiro City in Kushiro 
sub-prefecture for World Top Three Sunset).
    Mt. Hakodate is a land-tied island. The city hall is located on a sandbar 
(tombolo). In the Meiji period, the central business district (CBD) was located 
on the sandbar. Since then, the CBD moved inland; to the front of Hakodate 
Station in the Shôwa period, and to the front of Goryôkaku Castle in the Heisei 
period. When I visited Hakodate in 2013, I found many ``For Rent'' in the 
windows on the second floor near Hakodate Station.
   #2 The Tsugaru Strait has two necks (narrow parts of the sea). The east neck 
is between the Kameda Peninsula in Hakodate City and the Shimokita Peninsula in 
Aomori Prefecture. The west neck is between the Matsumae Peninsula in Matsumae 
Town and the Tsugaru Peninsula in Aomori Prefecture. The Seikan Tunnel 
(undersea tunnel) was constructed in the west neck, which is longer but 
shallower than the east neck (see the note of Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-
prefecture for the distance of Tsugaru Strait; see Fukushima Town in Oshima 
sub-prefecture for the undersea tunnel).
   #3 The former Toi Town [戸井町] in Hakodate City was located in the south 
end of the Kameda Peninsula. The name was derived from the Ainu word toi-o-i 
(edible soil, exist, place). It signified diatomite (Keisôdo). Toi was a 
village in the Edo era. The name was recorded in Matsumae-tô-gô-chô 
[松前島郷帳] (Matsumae island Gazetteer) that was published in the Tenpô period 
(1831-1845) in the Edo era. After the Meiji period, an administrative office 
(Kochô-yakuba) was established in 1879 (Meiji 12). Toi Village (2nd-class 
municipality) was established in 1902 (Meiji M35). Toi Village (1st-class 
municipality) was established in 1919 (Taishô 8). In 1968 (Shôwa 43), Toi Town 
was established (see the note of Matsumae in Oshima for 1st-class and 2nd-class 
municipalities). 
   The other side of the Tsugaru Strait from Toi is Ôma Town in Aomori 
Prefecture. Ôma is famous for Ôma tuna. The same tuna is caught in Toi. The 
price in Toi's tuna is more reasonable than Ôma (I heard this in the 2010s). 
Tuna in the Tsugaru Strait taste good because they eat flying squid. Tuna are 
warm-water fish and has been caught in Hokkaidô after the 1990s.
   The former Minami-kayabe Town [南茅部町] in Hakodate City is located to the 
east of the Kameda Peninsula (see Mori Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the 
name Kayabe). Administrative offices (Kochô-yakuba) were established for 
Osatsube village [尾札部村] in 1879 (Meiji 12) and for Usujiri village [臼尻村] 
in 1880 (Meiji 13). Osatsube and Usujiri were villages continued from the Edo 
era. In 1906 (Meiji 39), Osatsube Village (2nd-class municipality) and Usujiri 
Village (2nd-class municipality) were established. In 1959 (Shôwa 39), Minami-
kayabe Town was established by the merger of Osatsube Village and Usujiri 
Village.
   A hollow clay figurine was dug from a potato field in Minami-kayamabe Town 
in 1975. It is the only national treasure in Hokkaidô. Previously, Matsumae 
Castle (Fukuyama Castle) was also counted as a national treasure, but it was 
burned down (see Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the castle).
   The former Esan Town [恵山町] in Hakodate City is located in the eastern end 
of the Kameda Peninsula. It faces the Tsugaru Strait. In the the Edo era, 
Shirikishinai village [尻岸内村] was established. After the Meiji period, an 
administrative office (Kochô-yakuba) for Shirikishinai village was established 
in 1872 (Meiji 5). It was a continuation of village headman from the Edo era. 
An administrative office for Shirikishinai village was re-established in 1879 
(Meiji 12). Shirikishinai Village (2nd-class municipality) was established in 
1906 (Meiji 39). It became Shirikishinai Town in 1964 (Shôwa 39). The name was 
changed to Esan in 1985 (Shôwa 60). It was named after the sacred Mt. Esan 
(618 meters, volcano). The mountain's name was derived from the Ainu word e-
san-i (head, stick out, place), which means a cape. 
   The former Todohokke Village [椴法華村] in Hakodate City is also located in 
the eastern end of the Kameda Peninsula. It was the smallest municipality in 
Hokkaidô (25 km2, as same as Atsubetsu Ward in Sapporo). The place name came 
from the Ainu word tu-pok-ke (mountain foot, under, place). It signified the 
mountain foot of Mt. Esan. In the Edo era, Todohokke was included in Osatsube 
village. After the Meiji period, in 1880 (Meiji 13), an administrative office 
for Todohokke village was established. In 1919 (Taishô 8), it became Todohokke 
Village (2nd-class municipality) (see the note of Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-
prefecture for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities). 
   #4 The Port of Hakodate was a natural port. The Japanese called it tsuna-
shirazu (rope, no need). They also called it Tomoe Port (spiral port) due to 
the spiral-like topography. The Japan-US Treaty of Peace and Amity was 
concluded in 1854 between the Tokugawa Shogunate and the United States, and 
ports of Hakodate and Shimoda (in today's Shizuoka Prefecture) were opened. It 
was due to the efforts (pressure) of Matthew Perry, the commander of the East 
India Squadron in the USA. On his black steamships, he appeared in many ports 
in Japan after 1853. The Japanse were surprised at the ships. 
   In 1859, the Treaty of Amity and Commerce was concluded between the Tokugawa 
Shogunate and the United States. Along with Hakodate, ports of Kanagawa 
(Yokohama), Nagasaki, Hyôgo (Kôbe), and Niigata were opened (Shimoda was closed 
instead of Kanagawa). Foreign settlements were built near the ports, and cities 
of Edo (now Tokyo) and Ôsaka were opened for foreign visitors.
   #5 The Boshin War was a civil war between the new Meiji government forces 
and the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces. The final phase of the war is called 
the Hakodate War (see Kikonai, Matsumae, Mori towns in Oshima sub-prefecture, 
Assabu, Esashi, and Otobe towns in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the Boshin War). 
The commander of the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces was Takeaki Enomoto. He 
learned English from John Manjirô and studied in the Netherlands. After the 
defeat in the Boshin War, Enomoto was appointed by Kiyotaka Kuroda (an officer 
of the Meiji government forces), and worked for the Hokkaidô Development 
Commission with him.
   Toshizô Hijikata, an officer of the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces, was 
killed in the Hakodate War. In the Edo era, Hijikata had been the vice-
commander of Shinsen-gumi (the special police of the Tokugawa Shogunate).
   Shinpachi Nagakura was the strongest swordsman in Shinsen-gumi. Near the 
main gate of Hokkaidô University, there is a small plaque to him. He was born 
and raised in the Edo branch of the Matsumae Domain. He leaned swordmanship in 
Edo and fled from the Matsumae Domain. He participated in the Boshin War but 
not in the Hakodate War. In the Meiji period, he taught swordsmanship at Kabato 
Prison and Hokkaidô University (at the time Tôhoku Imperial University). It is 
said that swords seemed to be stopped to the swordsman.
   #6 As for the former Kameda City, which is now located in Hakodate City, the 
place name Kame-da (Kame-ta) in Japanese means ``turtle, rice field.'' It is a 
good-luck name as well as Chitose City in Ishikari sub-prefecture. (``Chitose'' 
in Japanese means ``1000 years.'' It was named after cranes. According to an 
old Chinese legend, cranes represent 1000 years and turtles 10,000 years.)
   In the early 17th century, the Matsumae Domain built a guardhouse (Bansho) 
in Kameda. It was moved to Hakodate in the 18th century. After the Meiji 
period, from 1879 (Meiji 12) to 1881 (Meiji 14), eight administrative offices 
for 28 villages in Kameda county [亀田郡] were established. Kameda Village 
(2nd-class municipality) was established in 1902 (Meiji 23). At the time, the 
villages of Kameda, Kamiyama [神山], Kaji [鍛冶], Kikyô [桔梗], and Ishikawa 
[石川] were merged. In 1919 (Taishô 8), Kameda Village (1st-class municipality) 
was established. It became Kameda Town in 1962 (Shôwa 37) and Kameda City in 
1971 (Shôwa 46). Hakodate City merged Kameda City in 1973 (Shôwa 48). 
   Kameda City existed only for two years and one month. Cf. Fushimi City in 
Kyôto Prefecture existed only for one year and eleven months.
   The former Kameda City is located in the west of Hakodate City. The area 
includes stations of Goryôkaku and Kikyô on the Hakodate Main Line. The address 
of Goryôkaku Station is Kameda-honchô, which means Kameda main town in 
Japanese.
   #7 As for the Port of Hakodate, Seikan train-ferries operated from 1908 
(Meiji 41) to 1988 (Shôwa 63). One of the ferries Tôya-maru was sunk due to the 
Tôya-maru Typhoon (Typhoon Marie) in September 1954. In the accident, 1155 
people died. Then, plans for the Seikan Tunnel (undersea tunnel) moved forward 
(see Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the undersea tunnel).
   These are the lyrics of the Japanese song Tsugaru-kaikyou-fuyu-geshiki 
(Tsugaru Strait winter scene); People who go back north are quiet. They only 
hear the sound of the sea.
   This was my sales pitch to invite master's students; It will be nice to 
live in this north island for two years. Cities in Honshû island are too hot.
   Travelers from Honshû island would think that Hakodate and Sapporo are close 
because they are in the same prefecture. However, it takes 4 hours by express 
train, 4 hours by expressway, and 5.5 hours by bus between Hakodate and 
Sapporo. The route goes around Uchiura Bay.
   #8 The establishment of Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ; a 200 nautical mile 
zone) ended deep-sea fishing. In the past, ports of Hakodate, Kushiro, and 
Nemuro were bases of deep-sea fishing, mainly for salmon and trout. In the 
past, fishing companies sailed to Russian and US Alaskan waters. Hakodate was 
the base of ``bosen (mother-ship)'' type fishing, while Kushiro and Nemuro were 
``bokô (mother-port)'' type fishing (incidentally, there is ``mother'' in 
``sea'' in French [mer/mère] and in Japanese [母/海]).
   #9 As for trade, the main importing countries are Russia (coal, fish), 
China (fish), and South Korea (petroleum products), and the main exporting 
country is Panama (flag-of-convenience ships) in 2011 by Hakodate Customs. 
Russian coal is used in the cement industry in Hokuto City. As for ship-
building, Hakodate Dock Co. produces bulk carriers, cement carriers, and 
fishing boats. As for fishery, squid are caught off the coast from June to 
December. Fishing lights float on the sea during the season. It is a fantastic 
scenery.
   #10 As for Hakodate's landscape of slopes, port cities have slope roads, 
e.g. San Francisco, Rio de Janeiro, and Nagasaki. Japan is a mountainous 
country and hilly and sloping roads are generally winding. Hakodate's sloping 
roads continue straight to the sea (see Yuni Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for 
straight roads).
   #11 The center of Hakodate City experienced great fires. They occurred in 
1879 (Meiji 12), 1899 (Meiji 32), 1907 (Meiji 40), 1934 (Shôwa 9), and 1945 
(Shôwa 25, air raids). There is a buffer zone near the city hall with horse 
chestnuts.
   #12 I visited Hakodate on field excursions in May 2013 and May 2017. In both 
years, a Toshizô Hijikata Look-alike Contest was held at Goryôkaku Castle. The 
winner in 2017 was a woman. As for tram, a very old car runs with a ticket 
seller on board. A red car also run. It is said that when you see the red tram, 
you will be happy. The tram's last stop is Yunokawa Hot Spring. It is Oku-
lzashiki, so called an inner parlor, of Hakodate. It was opened by the Matsumae 
Domain in 1653. In the hot spring area, there was a nice and inexpensive inn 
where we stayed during field trips. Today, it is difficult to stay at the inn, 
which became popular with foreign tourists.
   Local foods of Hakodate are Lucky Pierrot hamburgers, Madalena cookies of 
Trappistine Monastery, curry and rice, and grilled-chicken lunch-box of 
Hasegawa Store. The restaurant Gotôken was opened in the Meiji period and 
became famous for its curry and rice. Today, tourists enjoy curry and rice even 
in the morning at hotel buffets. Curry was brought to Japan through the British 
Navy, so navy cities such as Yokosuka appeal their curry and rice. In Hokkaidô, 
American teachers at Sapporo Agricultural Collage also introduced curry (see 
Kita Ward in Sapporo City). 
   About Lucky Pierrot hamburgers, I heard like this; ``It is popular than 
McDonald in Hakodate. They serve whale hamburgers. The shops are located in 
front of high schools. The hamburgers are large.'' Local foods in port cities 
are hearty and delicious (see Kushiro City in Kushiro sub-prefecture and Nemuro 
City in Nemuro sub-prefecture).

Nanae [na-na-e 七飯] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, south Hokkaidô (Dô-
nan). It is an inland town. The Kunebetsu River flows south and empties into 
Hakodate Bay. Mt. Komagatake (1131 meters, volcano) rises to the north. Lake 
Ônuma is located at the foot of Mt. Komagatake. The lake and the mountain are 
designated as a quasi national park.
   The name Nanae derived from the Ainu word naa-nay (many, stream) or nam-nay 
(cold, stream). Both referred Nanae-hama beach along Hakodate Bay, which 
belongs to Hokuto City now.
   Before the Edo era, Mishima Shrine was built in 1532. In the Edo era, Nanae 
[七重] was a Japanese village in the Matsumae Domain. After the Meiji period, 
in 1870 (Meiji 3), Nanae Kan-en (a government farm) was built by the Hokkaidô 
Development Commission. American advisor Edwin Dun instructed on Western-style 
farming at the government farm, including dairy farming and butter production. 
In 1879 (Meiji 12), an administrative office (Kochô-yakuba) of Nanae [七飯] was 
established by the merger of Nanae and Iida [飯田] villages. Also, an 
administrative office of Ônakayama [大中山] was established by the merger of 
Ôkawa [大川] and Nakajima [中島] villages. In 1885 (Meiji 18), Nanae merged 
Ônakayama's administrative office. In 1902 (Meiji 35), Nanae Village (2nd-class 
municipality) was established and Nanae Station on Hokkaidô Railway (now 
Hakodate Main Line) opened. In 1907 (Meiji 40), Nanae Village (1st-class 
municipality) was established. In 1957 (Shôwa 32), Nanae Town was established  
(see the note of Matsumae in Oshima for 1st-class and 2nd-class 
municipalities). #1 #2
   Nanae's town hall and the center of the town are located on the south of the 
Hakodate Plain (the part is called Ôno Plain). National Route 5 (Ônuma-kokudô) 
and the Hakodate Main Line run through the plain. The row of red pine trees 
(Akamatsu) along National Route 5 is designated as one of the 100 Roads of 
Japan. The south part of Nanae Town, including Ônakayama Station is an urban 
area that continues from Hakodate City. The population of Nanae increased. It 
is the second largest town (machi) in Hokkaidô after Otofuke in Tokachi. #3 #4 
#5
   Distinctive industries of Nanae are manufacturing, agriculture, dairy 
farming, and sightseeing. The main manufacturing products are soft drinks 
(including Guaraná), wine, and semiconductors. FAMING --> pasture 669 hectares 
in 2015, paddy rice 400, fodder 280, carrots 210, green onions 114, radishes 
89, orchards 60, flowers 22 (carnations and other flowers), spinach 18, beans 
(soybeans 9, adzuki beans 4, other beans 4), tomatoes 11, cabbage 8, cucumbers 
8, onions 3, broccoli 3, apples X (concealed), other vegetables 91+X (sweet 
corn, pumpkins, asparagus), other grains 3; dairy cows 1988 head in 2015, and 
hens 128,000. #6
   As for sightseeing, Ônuma has been designated as one of the New Three Scenic 
Views of Japan. It was selected in 1915 (Taishô 4). Niyama Ski Ground is 
located next to Niyama Station. #7 #8

   #1 As for Nanae Governmental Farm; in 1863, at the end of the Edo era, the 
Gaertner brothers from Prussia lent the land and started Western-style farming. 
The area was 990 hectares (twice as large as Hokkaidô University's ranch in 
Shizunai). 
   The Gaertner brothers cultivated apples, pears, gooseberries, cherries, and 
vegetables besides their trade and consular duties. That was the first Western 
variety of apples cultivated in Japan. The brothers taught Western-style 
farming to neighboring farmers. 
   They sold food to foreign ships in the Port of Hakodate, which was opened in 
1854. There are no photographs or paintings of the brothers. Their appearance 
is unknown. 
   The beech forest along National Route 5 was planted by the Gaertner 
brothers. (Beech forest was used for grazing pigs in Germany. The meat of wild 
boars that eat acorns is good.)
   In 1870 (Meiji 3), the Gaertners' farm was closed and Nanae Government Farm 
(Nanae-kan-en) opened on the site. The Meiji government bought the land back. 
To start Western-style farming in Hokkaidô, the government built five 
experiment farms in Tokyo and Hokkaidô (Aoyama and Azabu in Tokyo; Nanae, 
Sapporo, and Nemuro in Hokkaidô). Nanae was the largest one. 
   An English writer Isabella Lucy Bird visited the government farm in 1878. 
She reported the scenery like this; It is like a Western country. The farm 
have Western-style buildings such as animal stables, a large watermill, and a 
butter factory. (See Mori Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the writer). 
   In 1882, the Hokkaidô Development Commission was abolished. Then, Nanae 
Government Farm was gradually sold off and closed in 1894. Its stone wall 
remains near Nanae Elementary School.
   #2 Nanae Town belongs to Kameda county. The name Kame-da is Japanese. It 
means ``turtle, paddy field.'' It is a good-luck name (see the note of Hakodate 
City in Oshima sub-prefecture).
   #3 Mt. Nanae (779 m) rises near the center of the town. The night view of 
Hakodate City's downtown from Mt. Nanae is called Hakodate-ura-yakei (another 
side of Hakodate night view).
   #4 Ônuma Station on the Hakodate Main Line is the junction between Ônma main 
route and Sawara branch route (see Mori Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the 
branch route). There is another branch route to the south of Ônuma Station 
between Ônuma and  Nanae stations. It was constructed by the Japanese National 
Railways in 1966 to increase railway transport capacity. Just after this 
Japanese motorization started. (If you read ``The Grapes of Wrath'', you find
that motorization in the USA started before the 1930s.)
   #5 The big pine trees along National Route 5 are reminiscent of old trails 
in Honshû island. The pine trees were transplanted from Goryôkaku Castle to the 
roadside in 1876 (Meiji 9). It was transplanted to make a scenic road just
before Emperor Meiji visited Nanae Government Farm.
   #6 Guaraná is a popular drink in Brazil. It is like Coca-Cola. Guaraná is 
made from red berries (Guaraná) native to the Amazon region. After the war, 
Coca-Cola became popular in Honshû island. Before the American product landed 
in Hokkaidô island, a company in Nanane started to produce and sell Guaraná. It 
is still popular in Hokkaidô. 
   The Japanese pronounce Guaraná as ``ga-ra-na'' like in English, however in 
Brazil, they pronounce ``gu-a-ra-ná'' like in Latin. Gu-a-ra-na is the original
pronunciation. When I ordered Guaraná in Brazil by saying ``Ah, ga-ra-na,'' 
they served water (água, né?). (see Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for 
local foods).
   #7 The other New Three Scenic Views of Japan are Mihono-matsubara in 
Shizuoka Prefecture and Yabakei in Ôita Prefecture, Kyushû island. The 
original Three Scenic Views are located in Honshû island; Matsushima in 
Miyagi Prefecture, Amano-hashidate in Kyôto Prefecture, and Itsukushima in 
Hiroshima Prefecture. They were selected in 1643 during the Edo era. 
   #8 Ônuma Quasi National Park includes Lake Ônuma, Lake Konuma, and Lake 
Junsai. The shapes of the lakes were formed by the eruption of Mt. Komagatake 
in 1640. Sweet fish and shrimp are caught in Lake Ônuma. Watershield (Junsai) 
is caught in Lake Junsai. In the end of the Edo era, Lake Ônuma was opened to 
foreigners for walking. 
   In the Meiji period, an ice factory cut ice blocks from Lake Ônuma and 
shipped them to Tokyo from Hakodate (by Professor Katsuhiko Yamashita at 
the Meeting of Hokkaidô Geographical Society in 2014). Ice was expensive in the 
past. 
   After the 1960s, villas were developed on the slope from Lake Ônuma to Mt. 
Komagatake. Aerial photographs show roundabouts (rotaries) and ``culs de sac'' 
in the villa area (see Otaru City in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for 
roundabouts).
   #9 There is a legend about Lake Ônuma and Mt. Komagatake; Masatane Aihara 
was the load of Ôdate fort in the 15th century. It was located in today's 
Matsumae Town. Aihara came to Ezo with Masasue Andô (his lord), Kakizaki 
Sueshige, and Nobuhiro Takeda (who later succeeded the Kakizaki clan). (See 
Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the old 12 forts established by 
the Andô clan.) 
   Masatane Aihara came into conflict with the Kakizaki clan. He was defeated 
and fled to Lake Ônuma. He drowned himself in to the lake. Later, the Kakizaki 
clan became the lord of the Matsumae domain in the Edo era (from 17th to 19 
century).
   Even in the Edo era, Masatane Aihara's horse was seen several times near 
Lake Ônuma. The horse had a very long mane that reached on the ground.
   According to this legend, the name of Mt. Komagatake signifies the Aihara's  
ghost horse. (Mt. Koma-ga-take means ``horse, of, mountain'' in Japanese. It is 
commonly said that the shape of the mountain looks like a horse.)
   The lagend of Aihara resembles that of Yoshitsune Minamoto, who was defeated 
by Yoritomo Minamoto, the founder of the Kamakura Shogunate. The Japanese felt 
sympahty for tragic heroes. It is called Hangan-biiki (Hougan-biiki) in 
Japanese. ``Hangan'' means the job position of Yoshitsune Minamoto (``biiki'' 
is sympathy). (See Biratori Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture for Yoshitsune's 
legend; see Niikappu Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture for Hangan-date Rock.)

AREA 111 KM2 (2010), FOREST 90, CULTIVATED 1; KAYABE COUNTY [茅部郡]; POP 4767 
(2010), 4979 (1990); COUNTRY SIGN --> GEYSER, PUMICE, & MOUNTAIN.

Shikabe [shi-ka-be 鹿部] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, south Hokkaidô 
(Dô-nan). The rivers of Honbetsu, Shikabe, Orito, and Tokoro flow to the 
Pacific Ocean. The Orito River flows from Lake Ônuma, which is designated as 
Ônuma Quasi National Park (see Nanae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the 
lake). Mt. Komagatake (1131 meters, volcano) stands to the north. It erupted in 
1929. Huge amounts of pumice were piled up by the eruption.
   The name Shikabe came from the Ainu word sikerpe (Amur cork tree, ``Kihada'' 
in Japanese) or sike-un-pe (carry, it, place). The latter means a place where a 
large mountain stood in the landscape, or a place where the Ainu got off their 
boats and carry their luggage. Both signified the mouth of the Shikabe River. 
#1
   As for history, in 1666, during the Edo era, a hot spring was discovered by 
Gengorô Itô from Tsugaru (now Aomori Prefecture). He saw a deer (shika) healing 
its wounds in a hot spring. It is the origin of the current Shikabe Hot Spring. 
In the Edo era, fishermen emigrated. After the Meiji period, in 1879 (Meiji 
12), an administrative office (Kochô-yakuba) of Shikabe village was 
established. In 1906 (Meiji 39), Shikabe Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established (see note of Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 1st-class 
and 2nd-class municipalities). In 1983 (Shôwa 58), Shikabe Town was 
established.
   Shikabe's town hall is located near the mouth of the Shikabe River. National
Route 278 (Esan-kokudô) runs there. At the foot of Mt. Komagatake, along the 
coast, Sawara branch route of the Hakodate Main Line runs. It detours the slope 
of Mt. Komagatake inland.
   Distinctive industries of Shikabe are fishery and tourism. FARMING --> 
pasture 52 hectares in 2015, fodder 16; and dairy cows - (zero). FISHERY --> 
walleye pollock 4165 tons in 2017, sardines 701, octopus 401, shellfish 327 
(including scallops), mackerel 146, squid (flying squid 134, other squid 8), 
right-eye flounder 125, yellowtail 95, Konbu kelp 89, salmon 75, Pacific cod 
55, sea urchins 47, tuna 11, akta mackerel 7, Hatahata 7, olive flounder 4, 
shrimp/prawns 4, herring 4, kichiji 4, trout 3, horse mackerel 2, other fish 
108+X, and other marine animals 62. Fishing ports are located in Shikabe, 
Honbetsu, and Dekima districts.
   As for the sightseeing of Shikabe, villas, golf courses, and a resort hotel 
are located near Shikabe Station (the station is located far from the the town 
hall). Shikabe Roadside Station on National Route 278 is part of Shikabe Hot 
Spring. A 15-meter high geyser gushes from the hot spring. #2

   #1 As for the name Shikaba (sikerpe in Ainu = Amur cork tree), Amur cork 
tree was used as a yellow dye and an intestinal medicine. Amur cork tree is 
called Ki-hada in Japanese, which means ``yellow, skin.'' 
   There are large Kihada trees at the central lawn of Hokkaidô University. In 
2018, during Typhoon No. 21, their large branches were fell down. The yellow 
stood out.
   The Ainu make Inau (ritual stick) from a branch of Kihada, Yanagi (willow), 
Mizuki (dogwood), and Enju (pagoda tree). They believe these trees have good 
spirits.
   Ainu's ritual sticks are to be found in the Forest of Archaeological Site in 
Hokkaidô University. The ritual sticks look like dread hair. (See Abashiri 
City in Okhotsk sub-prefecture for Enju tree; see Biratori Town in Hidaka for 
Ainu culture.)
    Cf. the Japanese make ritual sticks from Sakaki (broad-leaved evergreen 
tree) (Nihei et al., 2023). 
   #2 As for the Shiakbe Station, in the past, the name was Takamachi Station, 
because there was Shikabe Station on the Ônuma-dentetsu Line. The railroad 
ran along the Orito River from 1929 to 1952.  ``Takamachi'' in Japanese means 
hawk catchers in the Edo era. They caught hawks and falcons in Shiriuchi (see 
Shiriuchi Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for falconry).

Mori [mo-ri 森] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, south Hokkaidô (Dô-nan). 
The area faces Uchiura Bay (Volcano Bay). The rivers of Nigorikawa, Torizaki, 
and Oshironai flow. Mt. Komagatake (1131 meters, volcano) rises to the south. 
The area was newly established by the merger of Mori and Sawara towns in 2005.
#2
   The name Mori means ``forest'' in Japanese. The original name was Oniushi, 
which was derived from the Ainu word o-ni-us-pet (river mouth, tree, many, 
river). It signified the Torizaki River or the Mori River.
   In the 16th century, the first Japanese immigrants came from Tsugaru (now 
Aomori Prefecture). In the Edo era, Kayabe-basho (a trading place) was 
established by the Matsumae Domain for herring fishing (see Yoichi Town in 
Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for herring fishing). Nigorikawa Hot Spring opened in 
1805 in Nigorikawa Caldera. During the Edo era, villages of Washinoki, Mori, 
and Oshironai were established. The following is the history after the Meiji 
period. #3
   Old Mori Town; In 1880 (Meiji 13), an administrative office (Kochô-yakuba) 
was established in Washinoki [鷲ノ木] village. It covered Ebiya [蛯谷] and 
Ishikura [石倉] villages. In 1881 (Meiji 14), another administrative office was 
established in Mori village. It covered Oshironai [尾白内] and Shukunobe 
[宿野辺] villages. In 1899 (Meiji 22), Mori village merged Washinoki village 
(the administrative office of Mori covered six villages). In 1902 (Meiji 35), 
Mori Village (2nd-class municipality) was established. In 1903 (Meiji 36), Mori 
Station on Hokkaidô Railway (now Hakodate Main Line) opened. In 1907 (Meiji 
40), Mori Village (1st-class municipality) was established (see Matsumae Town 
in Oshima sub-prefecture for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities). In 1902 
(Taishô 10), Mori Town was established. #4 
   Old Sawara Town; In 1880 (Meiji 13), an administrative office (Kochô-yakuba) 
was established in Sawara [砂原] village. It covered Kakeruma [掛澗] village. 
In 1906 (Meiji 39), Sawara Village (2nd-class municipality) was established. In 
1927 (Shôwa 2), Sawara Station on Oshima-kaigan-tetudô (Oshima coastal railway) 
opened (now the Sawara branch route of the Hakodate Main Line). In 1970 (Shôwa 
45), Sawara Town was established.
   Mori's town hall is located near the mouths of Torizaki and Mori rivers. 
National Route 5 (Ônuma-kokudô) and National Route 278 (Esan-kokudô) branch off 
near the town hall. National Route 278 runs along Uchiura Bay. Mori Station on 
the Hakodate Main Line is the junction of Ônuma route (main route) and Sawara 
branch route. Heavy freight [fu-rei'-t] trains use the branch route along the 
bay. #5 #6
   Distinctive industries of Mori are fishery, agriculture, animal husbandry, 
food processing, and geothermal power generation. FARMING --> pasture 471 
hectares in 2015, beans (soybeans 184, adzuki beans 101, other beans 15), 
potatoes 225, paddy rice 207, sugar beets 119, wheat 69, radishes 50, fodder

   In the Nigorikawa district of Mori Town, farmers grow Onsen Tomato (hot-
spring tomatoes). They grow tomatoes in the greenhouses that are heated with 
hot spring water (see Biratori Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture for tomato 
production). As for sightseeing, Mori Station is the birth place of Ika-meshi 
(squid rice). Squid rice became famous all over the country for department 
stores' station-lunch festivals (there used to be many department stores in 
front of large stations). #8

   #1 Mori Town belongs to Kayabe county (Kayabe-gun). Kayabe was named after 
the Ainu word kaya-un-pe (sail, exist, place). It signified Mt. Komagatake. The 
Ainu viewed the shape of the mountain as a sailing ship (see Nanae Town in 
Oshima sub-prefecture for Mt. Komagatake).
   The Hazard Map of Komagatake Volcano was published in 1983. The map included 
towns of Mori, Shikabe, and Nanae. It was the first volcano hazard map in the 
country. Currently, each municipality publishes its own hazard map. Who makes 
hazard maps? Consulting companies meke. They are the main employers of 
graduates from geology and geography departments (by K. Mannen 2020 ``Volcanoes 
as seen from cutting-edge science (written in Japanese)''). Many of my 
classmates work for consulting companies.
   #2 The pronunciation of Mori Town in Japanese is Mori-machi. All other 
towns in Hokkaidô are pronounced ``xxx-chô,'' such as Kayabe-chô and Yakumo-
chô. The municipality decides the pronunciation. It is said that ``machi'' is 
located mainly in eastern Japan and ``chô'' is mainly in western Japan. By the 
book ``Mori-machi-shi (Mori Town history),'' the town hall surveyed the reason 
for the pronunciation in the 1980s but could not find the answer (cf. the 
former Ishikari 10 towns in Ishikari City were mixture of ``machi'' and 
``chô,'' see Ishikari City in Ishikari sub-prefecture). 
   The name Torizaki was derived from Torii (shrine gate) in Japanese. There 
was a shrine with many Torii gates in the forest. The place was called Torii-
ga-saki (shraine gate, of, cape). On the map published by Takeshirô Matsuura 
in 1859 (https://koukita.github.io/touzaiezo/map/), the river is written as 
Torisaki-kawa (Torisaki River). (See Setana Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for 
Japanese river names.) 
   #3 According to the book ``Sawara-chô-shi (Sawara Town history)'' published 
in 2000, the first immigrants came from Kanita district in Tsugaru in 1532. The 
name Sawara was derived from the Ainu word sar (reed) or sarki (reed), or the 
Japanese word sa-wara (sandy, field). The area has a long history and its 
origin is unclear.
   #4 As for Washinoki district in the old Mori Town, in the beginning of the 
Meiji period, the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces landed on the coast. It was 
during the Boshin War. The commanding officers of the Tokugawa Shogunate were 
Takeaki Enomoto and Toshizô Hijikata. They were aboard the battleships Kaiyô 
and Kaiten. The landing took place on December 4th, 1868. On the day, a strong 
wind called Taba-kaze was blowing (see Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture 
for the war; see Easahi Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for local winds).
   #5 National Route 5 runs along the railway to the north. The road connects 
Hakodate and Sapporo. The road opened in 1873 (Meiji 6). At the time, the name 
was Sapporo-hondô (Sapporo Main Road). The road crossed Uchiura Bay (Volcano 
Bay) by boat from Mori to Muroran. 
   In 1878 (Meiji 11), the British author and explorer Isabella Lucy Bird 
stayed at an inn in Mori. She was traveling from Hakodate to Biratori to see 
Ainu culture. She documented Mori like this, ``It is a large village in the sout
h of Volcano Bay, however, the houses are about to collapse at any moment.'' 
But she liked the landscape from the inn (see Nanae Town in Oshima sub-
prefecture, Toyoura Town in Iburi sub-prefecture, and Biratori Town in Hidaka 
sub-prefecture for the British author).
   #6 The Sawara branch route of the Hakodate Main Line connects stations of 
Mori and Ônuma via the former Shikabe Town. During World War II, the rail road 
was constructed to increase transport capacity, utilizing the existing lines 
Oshima-kaigan-tetsudô (Oshima Coastal Railway) and Ônuma-dentetsu (Ônuma 
Electric Railway). The branch route opened in June 1945, just before the end of 
the war.
   #7 As for animal husbandry in Mori, there are swine farms managed by NH 
Foods Ltd. (Nippon Ham). The company's processing plant is located in 
neighboring Yakumo Town. 
   As for food processing, Nichirei Foods produces croquettes and minced 
cutlets. Maruha Nichiro produces salmon flakes and minced chicken. In the 
garden of Nichirei Foods, there is a monument that commemorates the birth place 
of frozen food in Japan. The company started frozen food business in 1920 
(Taishô 9) using a charcoal gas engine. The technology was imported from the 
USA. The company sold frozen fish in Tokyo.
   As for power generation, Hokkaidô Electric Power operates a geothermal power 
plant on the slope of Nigorikawa caldera. Geothermal power generation is 
suitable for the small and volcanic country. It has no fuel costs, however, 
there are these disadvantages; small output compared to the size of the 
building, high construction costs, and restrictions on construction due to 
nature conservation laws (many volcanoes are located in national parks).
   #8 Abe Shôten (Abe Store) started to sell Ika-meshi (squid rice) at Mori 
Station in 1941, during World War II. These are conditions for the success of 
squid rice; it can be cooked with a small amount of rice (during the war, the di
stribution of rice was controlled); the catch of flying squid is good; and all 
trains stopped at Mori Station because it was a junction with the Oshima 
Coastal Railway (Oshima-kaigan-tetsudô). Squid rice was born and became popular 
among young soldiers stationed in Hokkaidô. 
   In 2016, Abe Store's squid rice became vacuum packed, so, souvenir shops at 
Sapporo Station and New Chitose Airport started selling the original squid rice 
(there are a variety of squid rice from other companies). 
   Previously, the expiry date of the original squid rice was one day, so, it 
was sold through demonstration sales at department stores. Incidentally, squid-
shaped potteries of 4000-year-old were excavated in Mori Town in 2002.

Yakumo [ya-ku-mo 八雲] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, south Hokkaidô (Dô-
nan). The area crosses the narrow part of Oshima Peninsula. It faces Uchiura 
Bay (Funka-wan) and the Sea of Japan (``Funka-wan'' is a translation of 
Volcano Bay, see Oshima sub-prefecture).
   The area was newly formed in 2005 by the merger of Yakumo and Kumaishi 
towns. The former Yakumo Town was located along Uchiura Bay, the Pacific Ocean 
side. The former Kumaishi Town was located along the Sea of Japan. With the 
merger, Futami county was newly established. The name Futami means ``two 
seas'' in Japanese.
   The name Yakumo is Japanese. It was named by Yoshikatsu Tokugawa, who was 
the founder of Tokugawa Farm in today's Yakumo Town. Yakumo means ``overlapping 
clouds.'' He quoted the name from the oldest Japanese poem. Tokugawa Farm was 
the birthplace of the traditional Hokkaidô souvenirs; butter candy and carved 
wooden bear (a carved woodern bear with a salmon in its mouth). 
   The name Kumaishi was derived from the Ainu word kuma-us-i (fish drying 
site, many, place). The Japanese characters Kumaishi [熊石] mean ``bear, 
stone.'' #1 
   As for the history of Yakumo, in the early Edo era, the Matsumae Domain run 
a fort (ban-sho) in Kumaishi. It was the northern end of Japanese territory. 
Along the Uchiura Bay, there were trading places (basho) in Nodaoi [野田追] and 
Yûrappu [ユーラップ]. In the mid Edo era, the Matsmae Domain built a fort in 
Yamukushinai (Yamakoshinai) [ヤムクシナイ (山越内)]. It became the northern end 
of Japanese territory in the Pacific Ocean side. Then, the central village was 
moved from Nodaoi to neighbouring Otoshibe [落部] due to an increase in 
fishing immigrants. Then, the trading post Yûrappu was renamed Yamakoshinai. 
The following is the history after the Meiji period.
   Old Yakumo Town; In 1872 (Meiji 5), Yamakoshinai office of the Hokkaidô 
Development Commission was established. In 1879 (Meiji 12), administrative 
offices (Kochô-yakuba) were established in Yamakoshinai and Otoshibe villages.
In 1890 (Meiji 23), the administrative office of Yamakoshinai village was moved 
to Yakumo village. In 1902 (Meiji 35), Yakumo Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established (see the note of Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 
1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities). In 1903 (Meiji 22), stations of 
Yamakoshinai and Yakumo on Hokkaidô Railway (now Hakodate Main Line) opened. In 
1907 (Meiji 40), Yakumo Village (1st-class municipality) was established. In 
1915 (Taishô 4), Otoshibe Village (2nd-class municipality) was established. In 
1919 (Taishô 8), Yakumo Town was established. In 1957 (Shôwa 32), Yakumo Town 
merged Otoshibe Village.
   Old Kumaishi Town; In 1973 (Meiji 6), administrative offices (Kochô-yakuba) 
were established in Kumaishi, Ainumanai [相沼内], and Tomarikawa [泊川] (these
are a continuation of village headmen from the Edo era). In 1902 (Meiji 35), 
theose villages were merged and Kumaishi Village (2nd-class municipalities) was 
established. In 1962 (Shôwa 37), Kumaishi Town was established. Herring fishing 
flourished in Kumaishi from the Edo era to the Meiji period. The peak of 
Kumaishi's population was 10,049 in 1962 (Shôwa 37).
   Yakumo's town hall is located near the mouth of the Yûrappu River. It was 
the former Yakumo Town's town hall. National Route 5 (Ônuma-kokudô) and 
National Route 277 (Unseki-kokudô) branch off near the town hall. The Hakodate 
Main Line runs along Uchiura Bay. The name Yûrappu was derived from the Ainu 
word yu-rap (hot spring, down). It is an old name before Yakumo. #2
   Distinctive industries of Yakumo are animal husbandry, agriculture, fishery, 
and meat processing. FARMIMG --> pasture 4360 hectares in 2015, fodder 989, 
paddy rice 338, potatoes 90 (including seed potatoes), adzuki beans 67, 
soybeans 51, green onions 20 (mainly Nanpaku-negi), flowers 3, spinach 1, 
tomatoes 1, other vegetables 95+X (pumpkins and sweed corn), other grains 11; 
dairy cows 9111 head in 2015, beef cattle 4893, and hens 18,000. FISHERY --> 
right-eye flounder 642 tons in 2017, salmon 403, squid (flying squid 248, other 
squid 1), Konbu kelp 178, walleye pollock 156, shellfish 144, shrimp/prawns 81, 
octopus 66, yellowtail 52, crabs (snow crabs 22, other crabs 16), herring 21, 
olive flounder 20, Pacific cod 19, sea urchins 18, mackerel 16, akta mackerel 
15, sharks 9, trout 7, walleye pollock 4, Hatahata 3, other fish 236, and other 
marine animals 118. #3
   As for meat processing in Yakumo, Japan Food Packer Dônan Factory (a Nippon 
Ham Group company) processes pork and beef. There was also a Kentucky Fried 
Chicken experiment farm. It is now a tourist farm. #4
   As for sightseeing, Yakumo Hot Spring and Ken-ichi Hot Spring are located 
along National Route 277. Ginkon-yu Hot Spring is located along the Otoshimbe 
River (the name Ginkon means silver-wedding-anniversary in Japanese). In the 
former Kumaishi Town, Abalone Festival is held in late May. When I passed by 
the festival, a lot of cars gathered and the police guided them. #5

   #1 Yoshikatsu Tokugawa asked land granting for the retainers of the Owari 
Domain (today's Aichi Prefecture). Then, Tokugawa farm was established in 
Yûrappu district in Yamakoshinai village. When Yûrappu was separated from 
Yamakoshinai village in 1881 (Meiji 14), Yoshikatsu Tokugawa named the new 
village Yakumo after this oldest poem;
   Yakumo-tatsu izumo-yaegaki tsumagomi-ni yaegaki-tsukuru sono-yaegaki-wo
   (Overlapping clouds stand, fences within fences in Izumo, to live with my 
    wife, make fences within fences, the fences within fences) 
   It is said that the poem was read by Susanô-no-mikoto (a god of mythology). 
The lyrics are mysterious. Actually, it was an old song for wedding.
   Tokugawa Farm introduced Western-style agriculture, including dairy farming. 
They started to sell butter candy. As for the carved wooden bear (a souvenir 
from Hokkaidô), its prototype was a carved wooden bear from Switzerland that 
was brought back by Yoshichika Tokugawa in 1922. After that, making carved 
wooden bears became the winter job of farmers. Tokugawa Farm was demolished 
after World War II. At the time, the Allied Powers (US Army) ordered land 
reform.
   #2 As for roads in Yakumo, National Route 277 crosses Unseki Pass and 
reaches Kumaishi. The name Unseki means ``cloud, stone'' in Japanese. It is a 
combination of Kanji characters for Yakumo and Kumaishi.
   The town hall of the former Kumaishi Town was located along National Route 
299 (Hiyama-kokudô) on the Sea of Japan side. It takes about an hour by car to 
travel between the old Yakumo's town hall and the old Kumaishi's town hall. 
There were many reasons why they had to merge beyond the border of sub-
prefectures.
   #3 As for agriculture in Yakumo, during the Taishô period (1910s and 1920s), 
farmers produced potatoes mainly. Potatoes were processed into potato starch, 
and the potato starch was exported to foreign countries. Potato starch exports 
declined due to the Great Depression, and dairy farming increased after the 
1930. Today, Yakumo Town is the largest dairy farming region in south Hokkaidô. 
   The main species of dairy cow is Holstein. It is the largest species among 
cows and cattle (cows are for milk and cattle are for beef). Holstains are 
black and white cows. In Japanese language, it is also said roppaku-gyû (six-
white cow), because there are six white spots around the nose (see Eniwa City 
in Ishikari sub-prefecrure for dairy cows).
   As for fishery, the main catches in Uchiura Bay are farmed scallops, salmon, 
right-eye flounder, and farmed Konbu kelp, while the main catches in the Sea of 
Japan are walleye cod, squid, and farmed abalone. Deep sea water is used for 
the abalone culture (deep sea water is rich in minerals and low in bacteria).
   #4 As for chicken, I think it tastes better in Hokkaidô. Chickens may grow 
healthy under the cool climate without sweating. In Hokkaidô, fried chicken is 
called Zangi [zangui]. It may have been derived from a Chinese word.
   #5 As for meat processing in Yakumo, swine farms are located in the 
mountains of Mori and Imakane towns. Previously, Japanese Brazilians worked at 
the meat processing plant. There was also a Brazilian restaurant in the town. 
   A teacher who instructed the brass band at a local high school said; ``I 
sometimes went to the Brazilian restaurant. I got hooked on the bossa nova 
live.''

Oshamambe [o-sha-ma-n-be 長万部] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, south 
Hokkaidô (Dô-nan). It is located in the root of the Oshima Peninsula. The area 
faces Uchiura Bay. The rivers of Oshamambe, Monbetsu, and Kun-nui flow. #1 #2
   The name Oshamambe was derived from the Ainu word o-samam-pet (river mouth, 
bend, river) or o-samampe (river mouth, flatfish).
   During the Edo era, in 1669, the Ainu forces led by Shakushain advanced from 
Hidaka to Matsumae. They were defeated by gun corps of the Matsumae Domain at 
the Kun-nui River. Later, in 1773, the Matsumae Domain built a guardhouse and 
Inari Shrine there (incidentally, in 2022, water gushed out from the shrine's 
grounds up to a height of 30 meters). In the end of the Edo era, fishing 
villages of Yamakoshinai and Oshamambe were established. They were included in 
Yûrap Basho (a trading area manged by the Matsumae Domain). Yûrap and 
Yamakoshinai were located in today's Yakumo Town. Then, the trading post Yûrap 
was renamed Yamakoshinai. In 1864, the trading post Yamakoshinai was abolished, 
and villages of Yamakoshinai (today's Yakumot Town) and Oshamambe were 
established. #3 
   After the Meiji period, in 1872 (Meiji 5), Oshamambe office of Hakkaidô 
Development Commission was established. In 1873 (Meiji 6), a village headman 
(Kochô) was appointed. In 1903 (Meiji 36), Oshamambe Station on Hokkaidô 
Railway (now Hakodate Main Line) opened. In 1906 (Meiji 39), Oshamambe Village 
(2nd-class municipality) was established (see the note of Matsumae Town in 
Oshima sub-prefecture for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities). In 1923 
(Taishô 12), Oshamambe Village (1st-class municipality) was established, and 
Nagawa Line (now Muroran Main Line) opened. Oshamambe became a junction. In 
1943 (Shôwa 18), Oshamambe Town was established.
   Oshamambe's town hall and the center of the town are located near the mouth 
of the Oshamambe River. National Route 5 (Ônuma-kokudô or Yôtei-kokudô) and the
Hakodate Main Line pass the center of the town. National Route 37 (Shizukari-
kokudô) and the Muroran Main Line branch off there. Shizukari Pass and Rebunge 
Pass to the west are steep sea cliffs, so the old main road and railroad to 
Sapporo went inland from Oshamambe (they were today's National Route 5 and the 
Hakodate Main Line). #4 #5
   Distinctive industries of Oshamambe are fishery and dairy farming. FARMING 
--> pasture 1412 hectares in 2015, fodder 239; and dairy cows 2224 head in 
2015. FISHERY --> salmon 386 tons in 2017, shellfish 107 (mainly farmed 
scallop), right-eye flounder 93, yellowtail 27, sea urchins 20, walleye pollock 
17, crabs 10 (including horsehair crabs), olive flounder 13, flying squid 8, 
tuna 2, mackerel 1, octopus 1, seaweed 1, herring - (zero), other fish 38, and 
other marine animals 17.
   Fishing ports are located in Shizukari, Oshamambe, Ônaka, and Kun-nui. Crabs 
are the specialty of the town. The lunch box of Oshamambe Station is Kani-meshi 
(crab rice). #6

   #1 Oshima Peninsula is located in the south part of Hokkaidô. It is below 
(south) the line connecting Oshamambe, Kuromatsunai Basin, and Suttsu Bay. 
   As for the Oshamambe River, in the downstream area, natural gas is 
extracted. In the upstream area of the Oshamambe River, Futamata Radium Hot 
Spring is located. It is a secluded hot spring. 
   As for the Kunnui River, the name came from the Ainu word Kunne-nay (black, 
river). The river was black because it contained iron sand. Previously, the 
iron sand collected in Oshamambe and Yakumo was shipped to Muroran to make 
steel (see Kutchan Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture fo iron mine).
  #2 These are rivers with funny names in Oshamambe; The Kyûshi-battari River, 
which sounds like ``sudden death river'' in Japanese. The Warui River, which 
means ``bad river'' in Japanese. It was named because salmons did not appear in 
autumn and timbers could not be streamed (by H. Nagata 1891 ``Hokkaidô-ezo-go-
chimei-kai [北海道蝦夷語地名解]''). Cf. the name Enbetsu in Rumoi sub-
prefecture has the same meaning. It came from the Ainu word wen-pet (bad, 
river). It was bad because there were few salmon (dried salmon was important 
for the Ainu to spend the long winters).
   These are other rivers with funny names in Hokkaidô; 
   1) The Yarikirenai River in Yuni Town, Sorachi sub-prefecture, which sounds 
``I can't stand any more!-river'' in Japanese. The name came from the Ainu word 
yanke-nai (no fish, stream). 
   2) The Obake River in Urakawa Town, Hidaka sub-prefecture. It means ``ghost 
river'' in Japanese. Ghosts appeared along the river in winter. Usually, ghosts 
appear in summer in Japan (see Urakawa Town). 
   3) The Osaru River in Date City, Iburi sub-prefecture. It sounds ``a little 
monkey-river'' in Japanese. It came from the Ainu word o-sar-pet (river mouth, 
reed, river). Ainu's houses were made of reeds. In the upstream of the Osaru 
River, there even is Niagara Falls (see Date City). 
   4) The Chiri-chiri River in Shiriuchi Town, Oshima sub-prefecture. It sounds 
``geography geography river'' or ``dust dust river'' in Japanese. The name came 
from the Ainu word chir-chir-nay (bird, bird, stream). 
   5) The Doudoromappu River in Tsubetsu Town, Okhotsk sub-prefecture. It 
sounds like ``a muddy map-river'' in Japanese. It came from the Ainu word 
tu-utur-oma-p (two, together, enter, river). 
   6) The Ponkikin River in Tsubetsu Town, Okhotsk sub-prefecture. In Google 
search, ``do you mean Ponkikki? (an old TV show).'' It came from the Ainu word 
pon-kikin (small, hackberry). 
   7) The Kemichap River in Tsubetsu Town, Okhotsk sub-prefecture, which sounds 
like ``ketchap river.'' It came from the Ainu word kene-cha-p (alder, cut, 
river). 
   8) The Bochi-no-sawa River in Oketo Town, Okhotsk sub-prefecture, which 
means ``the stream of cemetery'' in Japanese. 
   9) Gakkari-zawa in Otaru City, Shiribeshi sub-prefecture, which means 
``disappointment stream'' in Japanese. It was an old place name around 
Asarigawa Hot Spring. There were hopes and disappointments in the pioneering 
days.
   #3 Shakushain was a chief of the Ainu. Just before the revolt of Shakushain, 
there were conflicts between Ainu chiefs. A rumor spread among the Ainu, ``an 
Ainu messenger who attempted to borrow weapons from the Matsumae Domain was 
poisoned to death.'' Then, the Ainu chiefs banded together and rose up in many 
places. The Ainu forces attacked trading ships, gold dust diggers, and falcon 
catchers. It is said that the background to the revolt was the trade imbalance 
between the Ainu and the Japanese. Also, the eruption of Mt. Tarumae in 1667 
may have caused food shortages.
   #4 As for population in Oshamambe, the percentage of residents aged 18 to 
19 is high, because there is Tokyo University of Science's Oshamambe campus. 
Students come in April and leave in February. The Oshamambe campus opened in 
1987, during the bubble economy.
   As for the population in Hokkaidô, Hokkaidô University is a water tower of 
population. It is a large university and students come from all over the 
country and from overseas. It has about 18,000 students. The number is larger 
than most towns and villages in Hokkaidô (cf. Tokyo Metropolitan University has 
about 8500). Undergraduate students live in Hokkaidô for four years and quite a 
number of them find jobs in Hokkaidô.
   (Before the 1980s, there were international students from Taiwan at 
University of Tsukuba where I studied. My teachers taught them. In the 1990s, 
our department had a field excursion to Taiwan, and the former students, 
at the time professors, were very kind to us. In the 2000s, I did not meet an 
international students from Taiwan, but there were many Korean students. Today, 
there are no international students from Korea at our department (Hokkaidô 
University and Tokyo Metropolitan University). Maybe they think there is 
nothing to learn from this small country (though many Koreans and Taiwanese 
visit Japan for sightseeing). I talked with a teacher from Beijing in 2024. He 
said, ``Today, Chinese students also want to go to the USA and European 
countries, but, Japan is still popular because tuition fees are low.'')
   Looking at a map of population density in Japan, Hokkaidô looks like a black
continet (HTTP://MOOO.COM/NOTE/INTF1.JPG); black=very low density areas, like 
an satellite image, spread. Japan is a country with a declining population and 
Hokkaidô island is one of the outstanding regions of population decline. 
   Today, most of people live in large cities and suburbs such as Tokyo 
metropolitan area. They consume rather than produce. (A teacher who moved from 
Tokyo metropolitan area to Hokkaidô said that his house sold for more than he 
paid for it.)
   #5 The eastern edge of Oshamambe town is Rebunge Pass. In the Edo era, 
Rebunge was considered as one of the three most difficult passes in Ezo (old 
Hokkaidô) along with Saru Pass in Erimo (today's Hidaka sub-prefecture) and 
Raiden Pass in Iwanai (today's Shiribeshi sub-prefecture) (see Toyoura Town in 
Iburi sub-prefecture for Rebunge Pass). 
   #6 The shape of the Port of Kun-nui is like a wine grass. Fishing boats can 
be anchored far from shore. Kun-nui is located at the innermost part of Uchiura
Bay. The tidal range is large. A long sandy beach appears at low tide. In the 
past, it was used difficult for fishing boats to leave the port.

(2010), 7747 (1990); COUNTRY SIGN --> WARRIOR'S HELMET.

Kaminokuni [ka-mi-no-ku-ni 上ノ国] is a town in Hiyama sub-prefecture, south 
Hokkaidô (Dô-nan). The area faces the Sea of Japan. Forests occupy 92% of the 
area. The Amanogawa River flows from Mt. Tongari. The Ishizaki River flows from 
Mt. Daisengen.
   The name Kaminokuni is Japanese. In the 15th century, the Andô clan in 
Tsugaru (now Aomori Prefecture) entered Ezo (now Hokkaidô Prefecture). They 
called the western part Kami-no-kuni (country, of, upper) and the eastern part 
Shimo-no-kuni (country, of, lower). The western part (upper) was near to their 
homeland. Shimo-no-kuni (lower) was located around today's Hokuto and Hakodate 
cities. The Andô clan also governed Kami-no-kuni and Shimo-no-kuni in their 
home land (now Aomori and Akita prefectures).
   As for history, in the early 13th century, the Andô clan in Tsugaru traded 
with the Ainu. The Andô clan also managed exiles by the order of the Kamakura 
Shogunate. In the mid 15th century, the Nanbu clan advanced to Tsugaru, and 
Masasue Andô and his vassals escaped to Ezo. They build 12 forts. In today's 
Kaminokuni area, there were forts of Hanazawa-date and Hiishi-date. Japanese 
settlements were built around the forts. Those were very old Japanese 
settlements in Ezo (see Hakodate City and Nanae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture 
for the Andô clan's vassals; see Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 
the oldest Japanese village).
   Koshamain's War occurred in 1457. Koshamain was an Ainu chief. Nobuhiro 
Takeda, who was one of the vassals of the Andô clan, ended the war. In the 16th 
century, the main fort of Ezo moved from Kaminokuni to Matsumae. In the Edo 
era (from 17th to 19th century), Kaminokuni was governed by the Matsumae 
Domain. Kaminokuni was a village of temples, shrines, and fishing at the time. 
(In the past, monks and priests were like today's civil servants. They 
recorded the names of places and people). #1 #2 #3
   After the Meiji period, administrative offices (Kochô-yakuba) for Kaminokuni 
and Shiofuki [汐吹] were established in 1872 (Meiji 5). Those were a 
continuation of village headmen from the Edo era. In 1879 (Meiji 12), three 
administrative offices were established; one for the villages of Kaminokuni, 
Kita [北], and Ôdome [大留]; one for the villages of Shiofuki and Kinoko 
[木ノ子]; and one for the villages of Ishizaki [石崎] and Chiisago [小砂子]. In 
1902 (Meiji 35), Kaminokuni Village (2nd-class municipality) was established 
(the seven villages were merged). In 1967 (Shôwa 42), Kaminokuni Town was 
established (see the note of Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 1st-
class and 2nd-class municipalities).
   Kaminokuni's town hall is located near the mouth of the Amanogawa River. 
National Route 228 (Matsumae-kokudô) runs along the sea. Previously, the Esashi 
Line ran along the valley of the Amanogawa River. It connected Esashi and 
Kikonai until 2014. The sites of the stations still remain (when I was writing 
this draft in 2019). There was also Amanogawa Station (Milky Way Station) for 
sightseeing. #4 #5
   Distinctive industries of Kaminokuni are fishing, paddy rice cultivation, 
and forestry. FARMING --> paddy rice 239 hectares in 2015, beans (soybeans 74, 
adzuki beans 8, other beans 1), wheat 71, buckwheat 37, pasture 5, orchards 5, 
fodder 4, other vegetables 30+X (snow peas, asparagus, and Nira (Chinese chive 
or gynmigit)); and dairy cows X (concealed) in 2015. FISHERY --> akta mackerel 
130 tons in 2017, olive flounder 44, sea urchins 34, salmon 27, squid (flying 
squid 12, other squid 15), octopus 25, shrimp/prawns 8, Pacific cod 7, 
shellfish (abalone 1, other shellfish 6), yellowtail 6, tuna 6, right-eye 
flounder 5, sharks 4, mackerel 4, sardines 3, trout 1, herring 0, other fish 
23, other marine animals 5. #6 #7
   As for sightseeing, Jôkokuji Temple is the oldest building in Hokkaidô. The 
current building was built in 1758. Hanazawa fort was located on a hill near
the center of the town. Today, windmills stand on the hill. #8 #9

   #1 As for exiles in the early 13th century, thieves and pirates in the 
western country, including Kyôto, were taken to the eastern country (now Kantô 
region). After their trial, some of them were exiled to Ezo (now Hokkaidô). 
As for Hokkaidô explorers, Tadataka Inô (explored in 1800) and Takeshirô 
Matsuura (explored in 1845, 1846, 1849, 1856, 1857, and 1858) are famous, 
however, more than 500 years before them, the Japanese lived in what is now 
south Hokkaidô.
   #2 As for Koshamain's war, in 1456, an Ainu man asked a Japanese blacksmith 
to make a large knife (makiri). After the knife was made, the Ainu man 
quarreled over the quality and the price. The blacksmith got angry and stabbed 
the Ainu man to death with the knife. Then, the Ainu united under the chief 
Koshamain and attacked the Japanese in 1457. The Ainu forces destroyed 10 of 12 
forts; Shinori-date (in today's Hakodate City), Usukeshi-date (Hakodate City), 
Nakano-date (Kikonai Town), Wakimoto-date (Shiriuchi Town), Onnai-date 
(Fukushima Town), Oyobe-date (Matsumae Town), Ôdate (Matsumae Town), Nebota-
date (Matsumae Town), Haraguchi-date (Matsumae Town), and Hiishi-date 
(Kaminokuni Town). 
   The Japanese escaped to Hanazawa-date (in today's Kaminokuni Town) and 
Mobetsu-date (Hokuto City). In 1458, Nobuhiro Takeda shot Koshamain and his son 
to death with a bow, and the war ended. However, conflict between the Ainu and 
the Japanese continued. Mobetsu-date was also destroyed by the Ainu in 1508.
   #3 As for the history of Kaminokuni, after establishing 12 forts in Ezo, 
Andô Masasue returned to the main land, and built Hiyama Castle, which was 
located in today's Noshiro City, Akita Prefecture. After Koshamain's War, 
Nobuhiro Takeda inherited the Kakizaki clan, which was one of the vassals of 
the Andô clan, and changed his family name from Takeda to Kakizaki. He built 
Katsuyama-date (fort) next to Hanazawa-date. His son, Mitsuhiro Kakizaki, moved 
the fort to Matsumae (see Matumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the history 
of the Matsumae Domain).
   #4 The spelling of the Amanogawa River in Japanese is same as the Milky Way. 
In 1614, Geronimo de Angelis, a Jesuit missionary from Sicily island, was 
heading for Matsumae, but landed in Kaminokuni due to a heavy storm. Later, he 
drew an Ezo map and marked his landing point ``Tçuga (Tsuga).'' The old name 
of Kaminokuni was Tsuga [天河], and the pronunciation of the Kanji characters 
changed to Amanogawa [天の川]. The old name came form the Ainu word to-ka 
(pond, shore).
   #5 The built-up area of Kaminokuni is lowland facing the sea. When Okushiri 
Earthquake occurred in July 1993, Kaminokuni's built-up area was very little 
damage by tidal waves, because Okushiri island between the epicenter and 
Kaminokuni acted as a shield. In Okushiri, more than 200 people died (see 
Okushiri Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture).
   #6 As for rice production in Kaminokuni, year 1993 was a crop failure due to 
cold weather. At the time, in Kaminokuni Town, where paddy rice cultivation was 
thriving, a crop-failure section was set up in the town hall (at the time, I 
was a university student and ate the Thai rice that was imported in an 
emergency).
   #7 As for Sansai (edible mountain plans) in Kaminokuni, on May 19, 2013, 
when I went on a geography excursion from Kikonai to Kaminokuni, I saw many 
cars parked in the mountains for picking wild edible plants.
   People gather edible plants in the mountains in south Hokkaidô. According to 
a graduation thesis submitted to Faculty of Letters, Hokkaidô University, in 
2013, fern pickers used to come Kaminokuni Town from Niigata Prefecture every 
spring. They stayed in huts in the mountains for picking, boiling, and drying 
ferns. When the season ended, they rented freight trains and sold ferns in 
Ôsaka and other places. 
   According to Takeo Ichikawa's book ``Nihon-no-shiki-to-kurashi (Four seasons 
and life of Japan)'' published in 1993, the wild edible plants grown in snowy 
regions are large and of good quality. A family in Murakami (Niigata 
Prefecture) earned over one million yen in one season by picking wild edible 
plants such as Zenmai ferns and blacken ferns (Warabi). 
   #8 As for old buildings in Kaminokuni, Jôkokuji Temple was founded in 1443, 
and Hanazawa-date (fort) was built around the year. Tategami Shrine was founded 
in 1473, and Katsuyama-date was built around the year. 
   The Sasanami's residence, one of herring mansions in Hokkaidô, is preserved 
in the center of the town. It is the oldest residence in Hokkaidô, which was 
built in the early 19th century.
    Those temple, shrine, and residence are designated as Important Cultural 
Properties. (Cf. the oldest building in the country is Hôryûji Temple in Nara 
Prefecture. It was rebuilt in the 7th century. See Hiyama sub-prefecture for 
the timber of the temple.)
   #9 As for old legends in Kaminokuni, Ôkura herring has been told since 
1590; A certain year, no herring was caught until the end of May. The fishing 
season was over. At the time, an old monk Shûkai Ôkura said to villagers, ``I 
will pray for herring to come. If you catch any, please share them with me. I 
will repair my temple.'' Villagers made a promise. The monk tied up a sacred 
rope, fasted, and prayed. A week later, seagulls covered the sea, Shikabe 
(albatross) gathered on the shore, whales spurted water and made big waves. 
Schools of herring arrived. The catch was larger than usual years and villagers 
were very happy. However, a perverse man refused to give his thanks to the 
monk, saying, ``It is just late this year, it is not your prayer.'' He got into 
a fight with the monk and the monk died. Villagers pray to the monk's spirit. 
When a small number of herring washed up in June, villagers called them ``Ôkura 
herring.''
   These are titles of other legends; the upside-down water pine (yew), the 
beheading pine, and the path of god. Maybe people made many legends during the 
long winter (see Yoichi Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture; see Esashi and Otobe 
towns in Hiyama sub-prefecture for herring fishing).

Esashi [e-sa-shi 江差] is a town in Hiyama sub-prefecture, south Hokkaidô (Dô-
nan). The area faces the Sea of Japan. The shape of the town is like the letter 
``B.'' The narrow part is the mouth of the Assabu River (Assabu Town is located 
in the upper reaches). In the Edo era, logs of Hiba (kind of cypress) were 
actively felled in the mountains and transported down the river. The area 
was the center of Hiyama (cypress mountain) (see Hiyama sub-prefecture for the 
name). #1
   The name Esashi is derived from the Ainu word e-sa-us-i (head, seashore, 
exist, place). It means a cape. It signified Kamome island in the Port of 
Esashi. The etymology is the same as Esashi Town in Sôya sub-prefecture. #2 
   As for history, Ubagami-daijingû Shrine was established in 1216. It is one 
of the oldest shrines in Hokkaidô. In the Edo era, in the late 17th century, 
the Matsumae Domain built a port for shipping cypress. Herring fishing also 
thrived. The old fisherman's song Esashi-oiwake includes the following lyrics; 
``Esashi no gogatsu wa Edo nimo nai'' (May in Esashi is nowhere even in Edo 
(old Tokyo)). During the herring fishing season, many fishermen gathered, and 
the Port of Esashi became bustling. Esashi was one of the largest ports of the 
Matsumae Domain along with Fukuyama (Matsumae) and Hakodate. #3
   In 1868 (Meiji 1), during the Boshin War, the former Tokugawa Shogunate 
forces occupied Esashi. In 1869 (Meiji 2), the Meiji government forces 
recaptured Esashi, advanced to Hakodate, and defeated the former Tokugawa 
Shogunate forces. In 1872 (Meiji 5), Esashi office of Hokkaidô Development 
Commission was established. Administrative offices (Kochô-yakuba) were 
established for 26 towns in the built-up area of Esashi. They were a 
continuation of town headmen from the Edo era. In 1880 (Meiji 13), a county 
office (Gun-yakusho) for Hiyama [檜山] and Nishi [爾志] counties was 
established. In 1897 (Meiji 30), Hiyama sub-prefecture (Shichô) was 
established, and the county office was abolished. In 1900 (Meiji 33), Esashi's 
26 towns and Gokatte [五勝手] village were merged, and Esashi Town (1st-class 
municipality) was established (see the note of Matsumae Town in Oshima for 1st-
class and 2nd-class municipalities). #4
   In 1955 (Shôwa 30), Esashi Town merged Tomari [泊] Village. The shape of 
Tomari was already like the letter ``B.'' #5
   Esashi's town hall, Hiyama sub-prefecture bureau, and the Port of Esashi are 
located to the south. The port is the terminal of National Route 227 (Ôno-
kokudô) and National Route 228 (Matsumae-kokudô). A ferry line connects Esashi 
and Okushiri island. Previously, the Esashi Line connected Esashi, Kikonai, and 
Hakodate until 2014.
   Near the mouth of the Assabu River, National Route 227 and National Route 
229 (Hiyama-kokudô) branch off. National Route 227 turns east, runs along the 
river, crosses the ridge, and leads to the Ôno Plain (Hakodate Plain). It was 
one of the routes the Meiji government forces advanced to Goryôkaku Castle 
during the Boshin War.
   Distinctive industries of Esashi are fishery and sightseeing. FARMING --> 
paddy rice 268 hectares in 2015, beans (soybeans 112, adzuki beans 20, other 
beans 1), potatoes 48, wheat 32, broccoli 21, pasture 13, fodder 7, orchards 4, 
flowers 3, yams 1, tomatoes 1, other vegetables 35+X, other grains 28; and 
dairy cows X (concealed) in 2015. FISHERY --> red snow crabs 438 tons in 2017, 
squid (flying squid 314, other squid 2), octopus 59, sea urchins 25, salmon 19, 
olive flounder 15, yellowtail 7, akta mackerel 7, shellfish 6 (including Ezo-
baka-gai (mactra), abalone), seaweed (Konbu kelp 1, other seaweed 5), Pacific 
cod 5, right-eye flounder 4, trout 3, shrimp/prawns 3, sharks 1, herring 1, 
other fish 51, and other marine animals 20 (including sea cucumbers).
   Tourist destinations are Kamomo island (seagull island), Kaiyô-maru Memorial 
Hall (a battle ship during the Boshin War), the former Nakamura residence (old 
merchant's mansion), and a marina in the Port of Esashi. #6 #7 #8 #9
 
   #1 As for vegetation in Hiyama, Hiyama-koji-no-mori (Hiyama ancient forest) 
is designated as National Natural Monument. It is located near the border with 
Kaminokuni Town (border is located far from the center). 
   Natural Hinoki-asunaro (kind of cypress) and Ao-todomatsu (kind of fir) are 
preserved in the protected area. 
   Esasi-sô (Esashi grass) is a kind of white mullein. The plant was imported 
from Europe in the Meiji period. It naturalized in Esashi Town after the war. 
   #2 As for the name Esashi, another interpretation is the Ainu word e-sas-us 
(eat, Konbu kelp, exist). There is a legend; Long ago, there was a famine. The 
Ainu of the north coast came here and survived on Konbu kelp (see Shin-hidaka 
Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture for Konbu kelp).
   #3 As for the history of Esashi, the festival of Ubagami-daijingû Shrine has 
been held since 1644. It is one of the oldest festivals in Hokkaidô. 
   Matsuura Takeshiro, who recorded place names in Ezo (now Hokkaidô), spent a 
winter in Esashi during his 2nd survey in 1846. He earned travel expenses by 
carving seals.
    Esashi-oiwake is a folk song from the Edo era. It relates to herring 
fishing. The lyrics are diverse, for example;
   ``Kuniwo hanarete ah ezogashima yansanoê ikuyo nezameno namimakura.''
   (Left the country, ah, came to Ezo island, yansanoê, how many nights have 
    I woken up with the waves as my pillow.)
   ``Naniwo yumemite nakukayo chidori nê kokowa esashino karino yado.''
   (What are you calling and dreaming, seagulls?, nê, this is a temporary 
    lodging in Esashi.)
   In the past, herring shoals spawned off the coast of Hokkaidô from March to 
May. Herring were processed into herring meal and transported to Ôsaka by 
Kitamae-bune (northern-bound ship), where they were sold to fertilizer 
wholesalers. Herring was also processed into Migaki (dried herring for eat) and 
shipped to the mainland (Naichi).
   In the Edo era, herring meal and dried sardines were used as Kinpi, which 
means ``gold fertilizer'' or ``money fertilizer'' in Japanese. Large farmers 
started to buy fertilizer with money (in the past, farmers used leaf litter, 
livestock manure, and human manure as fertilizers). The money fertilizer Kinpi 
was used for commercial crops such as indigo, rapeseed, and cotton. (for 
herring fishing, see Yoichi Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture, Otobe Town, and 
Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture).
   #4 As for the history of Esashi, the Gokatte River and the Port of Gokatte 
are located to the south of the built-up area of Esashi. Gokkate-ya-yôkan 
(sweet bean paste) is a souvenir from Esashi. In the Edo era, Gokatte-gumi 
(group of lumberjacks) came from the Nanbu region (today's Iwate and Aomori 
prefectures). Besides felling trees, they succeeded in cultivating adzuki-
beans. They made sweet adzuki-bean paste and presented it to the lord of the 
Matsumae Domain. Presents to feudal lords were called kenjou-hin in Japanese. 
The word kenjou-hin is used as an advertisements even today (the product has a 
long history and is of good quality).
   #5 As for the former Tomari Village, an administrative office (Kochô-yakuba) 
was built in 1878 (Meiji 11) (by ``2016 Esashi-chô-kyôiku-suishin-keikaku''). 
In 1906 (Meiji 39), Tomari Village (2nd-class municipality) was established. 
Until 1955, there were three Tomari villages in Hokkaidô; Tomari in Esashi 
county (Hiyama sub-prefecture), Tomari in Furuu county (Shiribeshi sub-
prefecture), and Tomari in Kunashiri county (Kunashir island) (see Tomari Town 
in Shiribeshi for the origin of the place name).
   #6 Kamome island in Esashi is a tombolo (linked island). ``Kamome'' means 
seagull in Japanese. These are tourist destinations in Kamome island; Heishi 
Rock - it looks like a religious vase; Senjô-jiki - a large flat rock eroded by 
waves (Senjô-jiki means 1000 tatami mats); Yoshitsune-no-uma-iwa - a white rock 
that looks like the horse of Yoshitsune Minamoto; Benkei-no-ashiato - 
footprints of Benkei Musashibô (Benkei was a vassal of Yoshitsune); Tokugawa 
Shogunate batterery site - it was set by the Matsumae Domain in 1852; and a 
sand beach for summer vacation. (See Biratori Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture and 
Otobe Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for Yoshitsune's legends).
   #7 As for the Kaiyô-maru museum in Esashi, Kaiyô-maru as a battleship of the 
Tokugawa Shogunate. It was made in the Netherlands. During the Boshin War, the 
former Tokugawa Shogunate forces advanced from Hakodate to Matsumae and Esashi. 
The battleship also headed from Hakodate to Esashi. After occupying Esashi, in 
December 1869 (Meiji 1), the ship ran aground and sank due to a strong wind. 
The wind is called ``Taba-kaze (Taba wind),'' a local wind in winter. 
   The shogunate's commander Toshizô Hijikata thought of the sunken ship and 
cried, hitting the trunk of a pine tree. Later, a not appeared on the pine tree 
and came to be called ``Toshizô's fist.'' It is the Pine of Lament (nageki-no-
matsu) in front of the old Hiyama and Nishi County Administrative Office (see 
Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the Bohin War). 
   #8 As for local wind in Esashi, Taba-kaze (Taba wind), which sank the 
battleship Kaiyô-maru, is a strong winter wind blowing from the northwest. 
Japanese fishermen feared the wind. They thought that the wind had a soul and 
called it ``Tama-kaze (soul wind),'' which changed to ``Taba-kaze.''
   Houses in Esashi were surrounded by fences in winter. The sound of the wind 
hitting the fences was called ``Mogari-bue (Mogari-fence's whistle).'' That was 
the sound-scape of Esashi in winter. Today, there are windmills on the 
mountains, which are managed by Esashi Wind Power Co. (a subsidiary of 
J-Power).
   These are local winds in Hokkaidô; Taba-kaze (Hiyama sub-prefecture), Dashi-
kaze (Suttsu Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture), Hidaka-shimo-kaze (Samani 
Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture), Shikata (Erimo Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture), 
Aikaze (Ishikari City in Ishikari sub-prefecture), and Bafun-kaze (Obihiro City 
in Tokachi sub-prefecture and other places). 
   In the past, due to a wind in early spring, 60 herring fishing boats sank 
off Teuri island (see Haboro Town in Rumoi sub-prefecture). In a novel, which 
was written based on an acutual incident, there is Kuma-kaze (bear wind). It 
blew after a man-eating bear was killed (see Tomamae Town in Rumoi sub-
prefecture).
   Long ago, in the Port of Esashi, there lived an old Ainu woman whose name 
was Orii. She was a prophet who predicted weather and wind. She also said that 
the net for herring fishing should be 5-shaku 3-sun (160cm) and has 63 meshes 
(not large, coarse net). During the Edo era, people followed her words. 
   #9 As for old architecture in Esashi, the former Nakamura's residence has 
been designated as an Important Cultural Property of Japan. It was built from 
the end of the Edo era to the Meiji period. The owner was a merchant from Ômi 
(now Shiga Prefecture). The Nakamura's residence was also a shipping 
wholesaler. Buildings in the residence are connected by passages. This type of 
the residence is called kaisen-donya-kenchiku [回船問屋建築] (shipping 
wholesaler architecture).
   In the past, along the Port of Esashi, merchant residences like the 
Nakamura's residence were lined up. They had piers to transport cargo to ships. 
   Esashi Town and Higashi-ômi City in Shiga Prefecture, which was the hometown 
of Ômi merchants, are sister cities. The ships of Ômi merchants were called 
Kitamae-bune (northern-bound ships). The type of the ship is called Sengoku-
bune, which means 1000 Koku ship (one Koku is about 150 kg of rice). The sales 
of one voyage per ship amounted to about 1000 Ryô of money. One Ryô in the mid-
Edo era was equivalent to about 50,000 yen today (see Otobe Town in Hiyama sub-
prefecture for Sengoku-basho (1000-koku-herring trading place)).

Assabu [a-ssa-bu 厚沢部] is a town in Hiyama sub-prefecture, south Hokkaidô 
(Dô-nan). It is an inland town. The area corresponds to the basin of the Assabu 
River that flows to the Sea of Japan (the area seems to face the sea, but the 
mouth of the river is included in Esashi Town). Regarding vegetation, Assabu is 
the northern limit of Hiba (or Hinoki Asunaro, a kind of cypress) and the 
southern limit of Todo-matsu (a kind of fir).
   The name Assabu came from the Ainu word hacam-pet (starling, river). It 
signified the Assabu River. The etymology is the same as Hassamu in Nishi Ward, 
Sapporo City. #1
   In the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain started cypress felling since the 1670s. 
Woodcutters from the main land (today's Honshû island) migrated. After the 
Meiji period, in 1868 (Meiji 1), the Matsumae Domain established Tate Castle in 
the upstream of the Assabu River. The castle was used during the Boshin War 
(1868-1869).
   In 1876 (Meiji 9), an administrative office (Kochô-yakuba) of Gamushi 
[俄虫] village was established. It was a continuation of village headman from 
the Edo era. In 1879 (Meiji 12), an administrative office was established for 
villages of Gamushi, Tsuchihashi [土橋], Mena [目名], and Akanuma [赤沼]. In 
1800 (Meiji 13), an administrative office was established for villages of 
Gamushi, Tsuchihashi, Mena, Akanuma, and An-noro [安野呂] (the five villages 
existed in the Edo era for forestry). In 1801 (Meiji 14), an administrrative 
office was established for villages of Gamushi, Tsuchihashi, Mena, Akanuma, 
An-noro, Tate [館], and Uzura [鶉]. In 1906 (Meiji 39), Assabu Village (2nd-
class municipality) was established (the seven villages were merged and 
renamed). In 1963 (Shôwa 38), Assabu Town was established (see the note of 
Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 1st-class and 2nd-class 
municipalities). #2 #3 #4
   Assabu's town hall and the center of the town are located near the 
confluence of Assabu and An-noro rivers. The town hall was built at the site of
Hiyama Agricultural Experiment Station. National Route 227 (Ôno-kokudô) passes 
the center of the town. In the past, the national highway was Uzura-sandô 
(Quail mountain trail), which was one of the routes that the Meiji government 
forces advanced to Hakodate.
   Distinctive industries of Assabu are agriculture and forestry. FARMING -->  
beans (soybeans 484 hectares in 2015, adzuki beans 196, other beans 7), paddy 
rice 555, potatoes 489, wheat 373, buckwheat 171, sugar beets 44, orchards 37 
(grapes 21), pasture 24, broccoli 24, cabbage 22, fodder 21, barley 17, green 
onions 7, melons 6, carrots 2, yams 1, Chinese cabbage 1, spinach 1, flowers 1, 
other vegetables 346+X (including pumpkins, asparagus, sweet corn), 
other grains 77; and dairy cows - (zero) in 2015. #5
   The local specialty is May Queen, which is a popular variety of potato along 
with Danshaku (baron). The town's country sign signifies a May Queen boy or 
girl whose face is long and smooth. #6

   #1 Staling (white-cheeked starling or grey starling) is called Muku-dori in 
Japanese. It means the bird of Muku tree (a kind of deciduous broad-leaved 
tree). In Hokkaidô, the bird is also called Sakura-dori, which means ``cherry, 
bird'' in Japanese. The bird migrates from the south during cherry blossom 
season (see Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for cherry blossom season in 
Hokkaidô). 
   #2 Cypress trees are different between Hokkaidô and Honshû islands (see 
Hiyama sub-prefecture). During the Edo era, tree felling started in early 
winter in Ezo (old Hokkaidô). The forest floor was covered in snow, providing 
good visibility, and woodcutters could move easily. They hauled the logs to the 
river on sleds. In spring, melting snow flooded the river, and woodcutters 
floated the logs downstream.
   The woodcutters who migrated to the basin of the Assabu River brought their 
Shishi-odori (dear dance). It became an annual event at the Hiyama guardhouse 
that was managed by the Matsumae Domain.
   In 1695, a large forest fire occurred. From 1770 to 1807, the Matsumae 
Domain banned logging to prevent deforestation. In 1876, another large forest 
fire occurred. So, very few natural forests remain. In Assabu, only Uzura-gawa-
goyô-matsu-jisei-hokugen-chitai (the northern limit of white pine natural 
growing area along the Uzura River) has been designated as National Natural 
Monument since 1928 (see Esashi Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for another 
natural forest).
   As for sled, sledding is an ancient transportation method. In Sapporo, 
mothers move their children using plastic sleds. As for snowy mountains, a 
female member of Hokkaidô University's Mountaineering Club said, ``When there's 
snow, we can go to the mountains we couldn't in summer.'' 
   #3 Tate Castle was built inland to avoid naval artillery. Cf. the capital of 
the Chôshû Domain (now Yamaguchi Prefecture_ moved from Hagi along the coast to 
inland Yamaguchi in 1863.
    In December 1868, during the Boshin War, the Matsumae Domain forces escaped 
to Tate Castle because the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces advanced to 
Matsumae Castle. In Tate Castle, Mikami Chôjun (samurai of the Matsumae Domein) 
fought using a cutting board as a shield, and was killed to allow his allies to 
escape. Tate Castle was captured and burned. 
   In January 1869 (Meiji 2), the lord of the Matsumae Domain fled to Hirosaki. 
He somehow found a ship in Kumaishi and set sail to the rough winter sea to 
Hirosaki, then the Matsumae Domain's forces surrendered. In May 1869, the Meiji 
government forces landed near the mouth of the Himekawa River (now Otobe Town). 
They advanced south and occupied Esashi in the same day. In Jun 1869, they 
advanced to Hakodate and ended the Boshin War (see Hakodate City in Oshima sub-
prefecture).
   After the war, the Matsumae Domain renamed the Tate Domain. In August 1871, 
all domains in Japan were abolished and prefectures were established. In 
Hokkaidô, Tate Prefecture was established in the south, and the rest was 
governed by the Hokkaidô Development Commission. In October 1871, Tate 
Prefecture was merged to Aomori Prefecture. In 1872, the Hokkaidô Development 
Commission governed the whole Hokkaidô, including the former Tate Prefecture. 
Meiji was a turbulent period (new religions also spread during the Meiji 
period; see Hokkaidô University in Sapporo City).
   #4 As for the place name Gamushi, it came from the Ainu word kamuy-us-i 
(god, exist, place). Probably the god meant bear (see Noboribetsu City in 
Iburi sub-prefecture for bear). Today, there is Gamushi Hot Spring along the 
tributary of the An-noro River.
   #5 As for beans, Assabu Town's specialties are Hikari-kuro-daizu (shining 
black soybeans) and black-bean pudding. Black soybeans are suited to machine 
harvesting because the color hides juice stains (astringents or tannins) from 
the stems.
   #6 May Queen was bred by Sutton & Sons Co. in England in 1900. It was named 
after the queen chosen at the May Day festival. The potato cultivar May Qeen 
was imported to Japan from the USA during the Taishô period (1912-1925). In 
1928 (Shôwa 3), May Queen and Danshaku were designated as recommended potato 
cultivars by Hiyama Agricultural Experiment Station in Gamushi (see Imakane 
Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture and Kutchan Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecrtue for 
Danshaku potato).
   May Queen is a popular ingredient in Oden (winter pot dish) in the Kansai 
region (central Honshû island), because they do not fall apart when cooked (I 
grew up in eastern Japan and have never seen potatoes in Oden).
   Sapporo Shusei Co. is located along the Assabu River. The factory produces 
Shôchû (liquor) distilled from potatoes and sweet potatoes cultivated in south 
Hokkaidô (I did not know that sweet potatoes were cultivated in Hokkaidô as 
a commercial crop, because sweet potatoes are cultivated under a warm climate). 
Next to the distiller is the agricultural cooperative's potato shipping center 
(see Nishi Ward in Sapporo for liquor production).

Otobe [o-to-be 乙部] is a town in Hiyama sub-prefecture, south Hokkaidô (Dô-
nan). It is located in the west of the Oshima Peninsula, facing the Sea of 
Japan. The area is mountainous. Forests occupy 87%.
   The name Otobe was derived from the Ainu word o-to-un-pe (river mouth, 
swamp, exist, thing (river)). It signified the Hime River that flows through 
the center of the town. In the Edo era, the river was called Otohe (by 
Takeshirô Matsuura's map published in 1859; https://koukita.github.io/
touzaiezo/map/). #2
   In the Edo era, the area was governed by the Matsumae Domain. Herring 
fishing thrived. According to oral tradition, Hanaiso-Suwa Shrine was 
established in 1617 (Genna 3) (the name was recorded in 1704). After the Meiji 
period, the new Meiji government forces landed Otobe in May 1869 (Meiji 2). 
They advanced to Esashi and Hakodate, and defeated the former Tokugawa 
Shogunate forces (Boshin War). 
   In 1879 (Meiji 12), administrative offices (Kochô-yakuba) were established 
for villages of Otobe, Komonai [小茂内], [突符], Mitsuya [三ツ谷], and 
Kabashira [蚊柱]. In 1902 (Meiji 35), Otobe Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established (five villages were merged) (see note of Matsumae Town in 
Oshima sub-prefecture for 1st-class and 2nd class municipalities). In 1965 
(Shôwa 40), Otobe Town was established. #3 #4
   Otobe's town hall is located near the mouth of the Hime River. National 
Route 229 (Hiyama-kokudô) runs along the sea and connects old settlements that 
flourished in fishery or forestry. #5
   Distinctive industries of Otobe are fishery, agriculture, fish processing, 
and forestry. FARMING --> paddy rice 127 hectares in 2015, soybeans 89, 
broccoli 26, adzuki beans 17, fodder 9, pasture 4, strawberries 2, orchards 2, 
radishes 1, other vegetables 32+X (including lily bulbs), other grains 20; and 
dairy cows - (zero) in 2015. FISHERY --> walleye pollock 286 tons in 2017, 
squid (flying squid 214, other squid 1), sea urchins 39, octopus 32, salmon 13, 
Pacific cod 5, olive flounder 3, Konbu kelp 3, shrimp/prawns 2, yellowtail 1, 
right-eye flounder 1, akta mackerel 1, abalone 1, herring 0, other fish 17, 
animals 16 (including sea cucumbers).
   Fishing ports are located in Otobe, Genna, and Toyohama (from south to 
north).
   As for other industries, CAC Cosmetics factory and Tomioka Winery are 
located in Otobe. The founder of CAC Cosmetics was born in a pharmacy in Otobe. 
Tomioka Winery  was founded in 1976. Today, it is run by Sapporo-shusei Co. 
whose headquarter is located in Nishi Ward, Sapporo City. Thomioka Winery sells 
Otobe wine.
   As for sightseeing, Gennadai Beach Park has been selected as one of the 100 
Beaches of Japan (by the Ministry of the Environment). It is the only 100 
Beaches in Hokkaidô.
   The country sign (gateway sign) of Otobe depicts the artificial seawater 
pool at Gennadai Beach Park. Other scenic sites include Cape Shibi-no-saki, 
which is andesite columnar joints that resemble tuna scales (``Shibi'' means 
tuna in old Japanese); Cape Tateno-saki, whose nickname is the Grand Canyon of 
the Orient; and Takise coast, which is known for Shira-hura (white sea cliff). 
#6

   #1 The Kanji characters for Nishi county (Nishi-gun) are difficult to read 
even for the Japanese. In the beginning of the Meiji period, Takeshirô 
Matsuura, an explorer of Ezo (now Hokkaidô), suggested Nishi-gun [西郡] (west 
county) for the county name, however, the Meiji government adopted the 
difficult Kanji characters because same names already existed in Honshû island.
   #2 As for the old name Otohe (``river mouth, swamp, exist, thing'' in Ainu), 
there were many ponds and swamps in the lower reaches of the Hime Rivier. They 
were reclaimed and turned into paddy fields and a built-up area. Today's name 
Hime means ``princess'' or ``noble lady'' in Japanese. In the case of Otobe 
Town, it refers to Shizuka-gozen, who was the wife of Yoshitsune Minamoto. 
   Yoshitsune Minamoto was the commander of the Minamoto clan in the 12th 
century. He was killed in battle in Ôshû (now Tôhoku region), however, many 
legends mention that he fled to Ezo (old Hokkaidô). This is one in Otobe; 
Shizuka-gozen came here in search of her husband but she could not find, 
because he had escaped far inland. She was disappointed and committed suicide 
by drowning in the river. So, the river was called the Hime River (see Biratori 
Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture and Esashi Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for 
Yoshitsune's legend).
   #3 During the Tenmei period (1781-1789) in the Edo era, Otobe was Sengoku-
basho of herring. Sengoku-basho means ``a trading place that has 1000-koku 
catches of herring.'' At the time, one Koku was equivalent to 150 kg of dried 
herring or 200 kg of fresh herring (see the note of Esashi Town in Hiyama sub-
prefecture for Sengoku-bune (1000-koku ship)).
   During the Tenmei Famine (1782-1788) and the Tenpô Famine (1833-1839), 
people migrated to Otobe from Nanbu (now Iwate and Aomori prefectures), 
Hirosaki (now Aomori Prefecture), and Akita. In Otobe Town, there are Sakaehama 
(``thriving beach'' in Japanese) and Toyohama (``rich beach'') districts. They 
remind us of the good old days. Herring disappeared in 1917 (Taishô 6) (see 
Yoichi Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture and Esashi Town in Hiyama sub-
prefecture for herring fishing).
   #4 In December 1868 (Meiji 1), during the Boshin War, the Tokugawa 
Shogunate advanced to the castle town of Fukuyama (now Matsumae Town). The 
Matsumae Domain forces escaped to Tate Castle in Assabu. Tate Castle also fell 
and they escaped to Otobe. The lord of the Matsumae Domain escaped to Hirosaki 
and the Matsumae Domain forces surrendered. The villagers in Otobe hid Matsumae 
soldiers by dressing them in farmer's clothes (see Hakodate City in Oshima sub-
prefecture for the Boshin War; see Assabu Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the 
end of the Matsumae Domain).
   #5 The name Otobe-jûjigai is located in the center of the town. Jûjigai 
in Japanese means crossroad. The name Jûjigai is to be found in the pioneering 
settlement of Fukagawa, Hakodate, Kushiro, Okushiri, Otobe, Shikaoi, Rumoi, 
and Yoichi.
   In contrast to crossroad, castle towns in Honshû island have T-junctions 
(teiji-ro) and S-shaped curves (kagino-te). These were for defensive purposes. 
They are obstructs for vehicular traffic.
   In Japan, motorization started in the late 20th century. My father bought 
Nissan Cherry in the 1970s. In the novel The Grapes of Wrath, famers fled to 
California in trucks in the 1930s. Motorization in the USA started at the 
begging of the 20th century.
  #6 Gennadai in Otobe is named after the Genna period (1615-1624) in the Edo 
era. A fishing port Genna was built around the time. It is a very old fishing 
port.
   To the north of Cape Shibi-no-saki, there was Kabashira village. The Port of 
Toyohama is located in the former Kabashira village. It is a funny (unique) 
name, because ``Kabashira'' means ``mosquito pillar'' in Japanese. The name 
came from the Ainu word ``kapara-sirar (flat, rock).''  (Once, I saw a large 
mosquito pillar in a hotel room in the tropics.)
   As for Shira-fura cliff, I guess that the name came from the Ainu word 
``sirar-hu-ra (rock, raw, intestine).''

Okushiri [o-ku-shi-ri 奥尻] is a town in Hiyama sub-prefecture, south Hokkaidô 
(Dô-nan). The area is Okushiri island in the Sea of Japan. It is the second 
largest island in Hokkaidôo after Rishiri. The area is about the same size as 
Lake Saroma. To the east exist coastal terraces, to the south paddy fields, and 
to the west and north coastal cliffs. Forests cover 86% of the area.
   The name Okushiri was derived from the Ainu word i-kus-un-sir (it, over 
there, exist, island) or i-kus-sir (it, over there, island). It signified the 
island across the sea as seen from Kumaishi.
   In the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain built Kujiri-basho (a trading place) in 
the island. Herring fishing prospered through the Edo era to the Meiji period. 
In 1879 (Meiji 12), administrative offices (Kochô-yakuba) were built for the 
villages of Tsurikake [釣懸], Akaishi [赤石], Yakushi [薬師], and Aonae [青苗]. 
In 1906 (Meiji 39), Okushiri Village (2nd-class municipality) was established 
(four villages were merged and renamed) (see the note of Matsumae Town in 
Oshima sub-prefecture for 2nd-class and 1st-class municipalities). In 1966 
(Shôwa 41), Okushiri Town was established 
   Okushiri's town hall is located in Okushiri district to the east. Other 
built-up areas are located in Aonae district to the south and Kamui-waki (or 
Yunohama) district to the west. Heart Land Ferry connects ports of Okushiri,
Setana, and Esashi. Okushiri Airport opened in 1974 in Aonae district. Hokkaidô 
Air System connects Okushiri and Hakodate airports.
   Distinctive industries of Okushiri are fishing, food processing, and 
sightseeing. FARMING --> pasture 41 hectares in 2015, paddy rice 37, orchards 
31; dairy cows X (concealed) in 2015, and beef cattle X. FISHERY --> squid 
(flying squid 417 tons in 2017, other squid 8), sea urchins 111, Pacific cod 
69, octopus 59, akta mackerel 58, shellfish 22 (abalone, Sakuragai (mactra), 
whelks), right-eye flounder 7, puffer fish 5, seaweed 5, olive flounder 4, 
yellowtail 1, herring - (zero), other fish 52, and other marine animals 23.
   As for food processing, local specialties are sake (rice wine) and wine. As
for sightseeing, Nabetsuru Rock, the icon of the island, is located near the 
ferry port. Okushiri Tsunami Museum is located in Aonae district. The country 
sign (gateway sign) of Okuhsiri is a map of the island. It illustrates strange 
shaped rocks and Bentengû Shrine. #1 #2 #3

   #1 In the past, Okushiri was an island of alcohol prohibition. When the 
catch of herring was poor, fishermen drunk a lot of alcohol and quarreled. So, 
village headmen (Kochô) banned drinking alcohol from 1885 to 1890. Today, sake 
(rice wine) and wine are the specialties of the island. There even is an 
``Ordinance to promote toasts with Okushiri's local sake'' (see Asahikawa City 
in Kamikawa sub-prefecture for sake; see Ikeda Town in Tokachi sub-prefecture 
for wine.)
   #2 Okushiri island is located near the boundary between the Eurasian Plate
and North American Plate. In July 1993, the Okushiri Earthquake (magnitude 7.8)
killed 230 people due to tidal waves (tsunami), fires, and landslides. Being
close to the epicenter, the first tidal wave arrived two to three minutes after
the earthquake. Tidal waves caused the greatest damage and killed 198 people.
At the time, television was broadcasting live footage from the sky. Aonae
district was burning. In 1988, the town declared ``completion of recovery.'' In
2001, Tsunami Museum opened.
   The Sanriku Coast in the Tôhoku region was hit by huge tidal waves. At an    
elementary school in the Sanriku Coast, all children could escaped from the     
massive tidal wave in March 2011. Their parents and grand parents taught them   
the word tsunami-tendenko (when a large earthquake comes, you must escape 
``alone'' as soon as possible).
   #3 These are strange shaped rocks in the island; 1) Nabe-tsuru Rock, which 
resembles the handle of an old iron pot. The shape was changed by the great 
earthquake in 1993 so it was restored, 2) Kabuto Rock (warrior's helmet rock), 
3) Hoya Rock (sea pineapple rock), 4) Mottate Rock (erection rock), and 
4) Muean-jima (lonely island). There are unique stories with the unique rocks. 
   The travel to the remote island strongly fascinates some people. Time is not 
consumed there.

TEMP 8.8 °C (AV 1981-2010), PRECIP 1056 MM; COUNTRY SIGN --> ROCKS ON THE SEA.

Setana [se-ta-na せたな] is a town in Hiyama sub-prefecture, south Hokkaidô 
(Dô-nan). The area is located in the west of the Oshima Peninsula, facing the 
Sea of Japan. Cape Obana is the western tip of Hokkaidô island. Ordinary 
tourists cannot go to the cape because it is a steep sea cliff. #1 
   The area was newly established in 2005 by the merger of three towns; Taisei 
[大成], Kita-hiyama [北檜山], and Setana [瀬棚] (from south to north). 
   The name Taisei means ``big success'' in Japanese. It was named by local 
residents when Kudô [久遠] Village and Kaitorima [貝取澗] Villages were merged 
in 1955.
   The name Kita-hiyama means ``north cypress-mountain'' in Japanese (see 
Hiyama sub-prefecture).
   The name Setana was derived from the Ainu word seta-rupespe-nay (dog, cross, 
river; ``rupespe'' was omitted). It signified a place near the Baba River, which
 flows the center of the old Setana Town. Large rocks stands near the mouth of 
the river; Sanbonsugi-iwa (Three-ceders Rocks) standing from the sea and 
Rôsoku-iwa (Candle Rock) at the port. They look like dogs. #2
   In the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain set three places for fishing and 
trading posts (the place is called Basho). They were located in Kudô, Futoro 
(at the mouth of the Futoro River), and Setanai (from south to north). They 
thrived from herring fishing. 
   After the Meiji period, counties of Kudô, Futoro, and Setana were 
established in 1869 (Meiji 2). The following is the history of old three towns 
in Setana after the Meiji period.
   Old Taisei Town; In 1872 (Meiji 5), Kudô office of the Hokkaidô Development 
Commission was established. In 1880 (Meiji 13), an administrative office 
(Kochô-yakuba) was established in Issôma [一艘澗] village. It covered other 
five villages; Ôta [太田], Uekotan [上古丹], Sansôma [三艘澗], Hikata-tomari 
[日方泊], and Yunoshiri [湯尻]. An administrative office was established in 
Hiratanai [平田内]. It covered other two villages; Kaitorima and Nagaiso 
[長磯]. In 1881 (Meiji 14), an administrative office of Kudô village was 
established (villages of Issôma, Sansôma, and Hikata-tomari were merged). In 
1902 (Meiji 35), Kudô Village (2nd-class municipality) was established 
(villages of Ôta, Uekotan, and Yunoshiri were merged) (see the note of Matsumae 
Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities). In 
1923 (Taishô 12), Kaitorima Village (2nd-class municipality) was established 
(Hiratanai and Nagaiso villages were merged). In 1955 (Shôwa 30), Taisei 
Village was established (villages of Kudô and Kaidorima were merged). In 1966 
(Shôwa 41), Taisei Town was established.
   Old Kita-hiyama Town; In 1879 (Meiji 13), an administrative office (Kochô-
yakuba) was established for four villages in Futoro county, which included 
villages of Futoro [太櫓], Gorota [古櫓多], Raruishi [良瑠石], and Udomari 
[鵜泊]. In 1902 (Meiji 35), an administrative office of Higashi-setana [東瀬棚] 
village was established (it was separated from Setana village). In 1906 (Meiji 
39), Futoro Village (2nd-class municipality) was established (villages of 
Futori, Gorota, Raruishi, and Udomari were merged). Higashi-setana Village 
(2nd-class municipality) was established. In 1953 (Shôwa 28), Higashi-setana 
Town was established. In 1955 (Shôwa 30), Kita-hiyama Town was established 
(Higashi-setana Town and Futoro Village were merged).
   Old Setana Town; In 1879 (Meiji 12), two administrative offices (Kochô-
yakuba) were established for five villages in Setana county; Setana, Baikatsu 
[梅花都], Nakauta [中歌], Abura [虻羅], and Shimauta [島歌]. In 1897 (Meiji 
30), Toshibetsu village (now Imakane Town) was separated from Setana village. 
In 1902 (Meiji 35), Setana Village (2nd-class municipality) was established 
(five villages in Setana county were merged). Higashi-setana village (an 
administrative office) was separated from Setana Village (later, Higashi-setana 
became part of Kita-hiyama Town). In 1919 (Taishô 8), Setana Village (1st-class 
municipality) was established. In 1921 (Taishô 10), Setana Town was 
established.
   The town hall of Setana is located near the mouth of the Toshibetsu 
(Shiribeshi-toshibetsu) River. It used to be Kita-hiyama Town's town Hall. 
National Route 229 (Hiyama-kokudô) runs along the Sea of Japan. National Route 
230 (Pirika-kokudô) separates from National Route 229 near the town hall and 
crosses the Oshima Peninsula. Formerly, the Setana Line of the Japanese 
National Railways ran along Route 230. The railway connected Setana Station and 
Kun-nui Station in Oshamambe Town.
   As for the former Setana Town, the Port of Setana has a ferry line to 
Okushiri island. The windmills near the port are the first offshore windmills 
in the country. In the built-up area of Setana, there was a clinic managed by 
Ginko Ogino, who was the first female medical doctor in the country. #3 #4 
   Distinctive industries of Setana are fishing, paddy rice cultivation, and 
dairy farming. FARMING --> pasture 2046 hectares in 2015, paddy rice 1537, 
beans (soybeans 353, adzuki beans 84, other beans 7), fodder 268, potatoes 153, 
buckwheat 146, sugar beets 64, wheat 48, broccoli 23, spinach 10, orchards 5, 
radishes 3, melons 1, other vegetables 46+X (sweet corn, pumpkins, asparagus), 
other grains 11; and dairy cows 2886 head in 2015. FISHERY --> squid (flying 
squid  618 tons in 2017, other squid 3), salmon 283, sea urchins 133, octopus 
65, Pacific cod 46, seaweed (Konbu kelp 26, other seaweed 5), olive flounder 
22, akta mackerel 19, right-eye flounder 17, yellowtail 16, shellfish (abalone 
2, other shellfish 10 (oysters)), shrimp/prawns 9, sharks 4, puffer fish 2, 
herring 0, other fish 92, and other marine animals 16. Local specialties 
include the sake (rice wine) that is made from locally grown rice. #5

   #1 Among the northern, southern, eastern, and western tips of Hokkaidô, the 
western tip (Cape Obana in Setana Town) is the most difficult to reach. 
   Including small islands, the western tip is Oshima-ôshima island 
(uninhabited island) in Matsumae Town, Oshima sub-prefecture (see Matsumae in 
Oshima for the southern tip of Hokkaidô). 
   Ôta Shrine at Cape Obana is one of the oldest shrines in Hokkaidô. It was 
established around 1441. It is one of the most difficult shrines to reach. It 
is located at the top of a rocky mountain. Bears live. Visitors are like 
climbers. At the shrine, they will pray for a safety descent. In the past, 
mountaineering was a religious activity.
   #2 As for the name Setana, on the map published by Takeshirô Matsuura in 
1859, Haha-gawa (now Baba River) and Setaruheshi-nail (Ainu's ``seta-rupespe-
nay'' river) are written together (https://koukita.github.io/touzaiezo/map/). 
   Tadashi Okudaira wrote that the upper course of the Baba River was called 
the Setanai River (by World Encyclopedia). When I asked the town hall, they 
answered that the Setanai River would signify today's Toshibetsu River 
(the Shiribeshi-toshibetsu River), according to the Setanai Basho Map (Setanai 
trading place map) drawn in the Ansei period (1855-1860) in the Edo era. 
   Hiyama and Oshima sub-prefectures have a long history of Japanese 
settlement, therefore, some river names and place names changed from Ainu to 
Japanese, e.g. the Baba River in Setana, the Hime River in Otobe, and the 
Torisaki River in Mori.
   As for the name Seta-nai (``dog, river'' in Ainu), this is the Ainu legend; 
Once upon a time, large dogs came down from the mountain, went into the sea, 
and became rocks. They were messengers of god.
   At the 1993 Okushiri Earthquake, tidal waves (tsunami) surrounded Sanbonsugi 
Rocks and reached the national highway (Route 229). After the water subsided, 
sea urchins and flounders were left on the road.
   #3 As for the coastal road of Setana, National Route 229 temporally runs 
inland at the border between the former Taisei and Kita-hiayama towns. The road 
detours Cape Obana, a sea cliff at the western tip of Hokkaidô island. Strange-
shaped rocks are to be found along the highway; Mother Bear and Cub Rock, 
Mammoth Rock, and Raccoon Rock.
   #4 Ginko Ogino (1851-1913) was born in Tawarase village (today's Kumagaya 
City, Saitama Prefecture). In 1885, she passed medical practitioner's 
examination and opened a clinic of gynecology and obstetrics in Yushima, Tokyo. 
She became the first female medical doctor in the country.
   Her husband Yukiyoshi Shikata started developing Immanuel district in 1891, 
which was located in today's Imakane Town in Hiyama. Ginko also moved to 
Immanuel in 1894. Her husband failed in development and became a missionary 
(see Imakane Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for Christian's development). 
   Ginko then moved to the seaside town Setana and opened a clinic in 1897. She 
went to Sapporo in 1903 to have a larger clinic, however, she was told that her 
medical technique was 20 years' behind, so she continued her clinic in Setana. 
   Her husband died in 1905. She returned to Tokyo in 1908.
   (Incidentally, about a medical doctor, I lived in a teachers' apartment in 
Miyanomori, Sapporo. Next to the apartment was a clinic for internal medicine 
and pediatrics. The elderly doctor said; I was originally internist, so when I 
added pediatrics, my friends scorned him, but I had to raise my children. 
   He was proud that his three sons became medical doctors. When I went to his 
clinic with the influenza, the doctor said; The latest machine to test the 
influenza is expensive. The debt remains with my son.
   After his sudden death, one of his sons came from a hospital and succeeded 
the clinic for about a year. Then, the clinic was demolished and an apartment 
was built.)
   #5 As for Setana's specialty, a graduation thesis submitted to Faculty of 
Letters, HokkaidÔ University, in 2010 was about Setana's sake (rice wine). The 
producers are farmers who cultivate paddy rice and brew rice wine. They sell 
two brandmarks of sake; Ginko-monogatari (Ginko's story) and Yoshiko. 
   Ginko-monogatari is made from the brewery rice that is cultivated by rice-
duck farming method. Yoshiko is made from Kirara 397, which is a common rice 
variety for eat (see Uryû Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for Kirara 397). 
   The producers wanted to use the names Kita-hiyama (old town's name) or 
Suisen (daffodils, the town's flower), but they were already trademarked. The 
name Yoshiko was chosen because it was a common woman's name in the town, such 
as rice-wine producer's wife and mother.
   The cultivation of brewery rice is difficult in Hokkaidô, so the rice-wine 
producers also use a common variety for eat (Kirara 397). Grains of brewery 
rice are large so they doesn't crumble easily after being scraped off. 
   Cf. Hokkaidô's wine is also made from the table grape variety Niagara and 
locally grown mountain grapes (Yama-budô) (see Asahikawa City in Kamikawa sub-
prefecture for rice wine; see Ikeda Town in Tokachi sub-prefecture for wine).
   As for brewery rice, Yamada-nishiki is the most famous variety in the 
country. It has been used for the rice wine made in the Nada region (now Hyôgo 
Prefecture in the Kinki region, which is located in the central part of Honshû 
island). The Nada's rice wine was also shipped to Ezo (now Hokkaidô) by 
northern-bound ships. It is said that the rice wine transported by ship tastes 
better (see Mashike Town in Rumoi sub-prefecture).

Imakane [i-ma-ka-ne 今金] is a town in Hiyama sub-prefecture, south Hokkaidô 
(Dô-nan). It is located inland in the Oshima Peninsula. The area corresponds to 
the midstream and upstream of the Shiribeshi-toshibetsu River (local residents 
call it the Toshibetsu River), which flows to the Sea of Japan (the downstream 
of the river is Setana Town).
   The name Imakane is Japanese. It was derived from two pioneers Tôjirô 
Imamura and Ishirô Kanamori (Ima- and Kane-). Both of them were graduates of 
Tokyo Professional School (now Waseda University).
   In the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain gathered gold dust in the upstream of 
the Shiribetsu-toshibetsu River. In the Meiji period, agate and manganese were 
mined.
   As for the history of the municipality, in 1893 (Meiji 26), two pioneers 
settled in what is now Imakane district. A group of Christians settled in 
Immanuel in the year. In 1897 (Meiji 30), an administrative office (Kochô-
yakuba) of Toshibetsu [利別] village was established. It was separated from 
Setana village. In 1906 (Meiji 39), Toshibetsu Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established. In 1929 (Shôwa 4), Toshibetsu Village (1st-class municipality) 
was established. In 1947 (Shôwa 22), Imakane Town was established (Toshibetsu 
was renamed to Imakane) (see the note of Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture 
for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities). #1
   Imakane's town hall and the center of the town are located along the 
midstream of the Shiribeshi-toshibetsu River. National Route 230 (Pirika-kokudô 
or Hanaishi-dôro) run there. In the past, the Setana Line ran along the river. 
The railroad crossed the Oshima peninsula, connecting Setana (in the former 
Setana Town) and Kun-nui (in Oshamambe Town). #2 #3 #4
   Distinctive industries of Imakane are agriculture, animal husbandry, and 
forestry. FARMING --> pasture 1446 hectares in 2015, paddy rice 1414, beans 
(soybeans 376, adzuki beans 208), potatoes 396, wheat 273, fodder 229, sugar 
beets 117, buckwheat 69, carrots 32, broccoli 24, barley 19, tomatoes 13, 
onions 5, other grains 24; dairy cows 2021 head in 2015, and hogs and pigs X 
(concealed).
   Potatoes are sold with the brandmark Imakane-danshaku. As for animal 
husbandry, Nippon Ham Group's swine farms are distributed in the mountains. 
As for sightseeing, Pirika Dam is located near Pirika Pass. The dam's long 
concrete dyke stands out from National Route 230. The country sign (gateway 
sign) of the town is Piiri and Piika, which are nicknames for sea cow fossils 
excavated from the dam construction site. #5 #6

   #1 As for the history of Imakane, the Christian group that settled in 
Immanuel tried to make their own utopia. The name Immanuel means ``God with 
us'' in Hebrew. It was today's Kamioka district. The name Kamioka means ``god 
hill'' in Japanese. 
   The first female doctor in Japan, Ginko Ogino, came Immanuel because her 
husband was a member of the group (see Setana Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for 
her clinic). 
   On the map published by Takeshiro Matsuura in 1859 (https://koukita.github.
io/touzaiezo/map/), there is a place name written as Imanpetsu. It may come 
from the Ainu word i-ma-un-pet (it, burn (or swim), exist, river). 
   The Christians may have imagined the word Immanuel from the pronunciation. 
(Updated in 2024; The place name on the map may be Imashipetsu (it, burn, 
large, river). Japanese Katakana characters are sometimes difficult to 
distinguish.)
   #2 As for the place name Hanaishi in Imakane Town, it means agate in 
Japanese. Hanaishi district near Pirika Dam had the largest agate mine in the 
country in the Meiji period. 
   The agate was shipped to Fukui Prefecture and carved into ornaments. Today, 
agate is mainly imported from Brazil. (When I visited São Paulo, a president of 
a Japanese company recommended that I buy agate chopstick rests as a souvenir.)
   #3 Near the center of Imakane Town, a large loop bridge stands out. It 
continues up to Hikaridai district, which is an agricultural area on a hill. 
The loop bridge is not an expressway but an agricultural road (Nô-men-dôro) 
that was built with gasoline tax. 
   Other loop bridges can be found in Sunagawa (Sorach sub-prefecture), Toyoura 
(Iburi), and Asari district in Otaru (Shiribeshi).
   #4 The name of the post office is Imagane (not Imakane). The name of the 
former railroad station was Imagane. The name on the map by Geospatial 
Information Authority of Japan (the former Geographical Survry Institute) is 
Imakane.
   The town's former name was Toshibetsu, which came from the Ainu word tus-pet 
(snake (rope), river) or to-us-pet (pond, many, river). It signified the 
Shiribeshi-toshibetsu River. 
   The Shiribeshi-toshibetsu river was ranked as the cleanest river of Japan 
(by Current Water Quality for Class A Rivers (Ikkyû-kasen) published by the 
Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism) (see Rankoshi Town in 
Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for the cleanest rivers).
   #5 Danshaku (baron) and May Queen are the two major varieties of potatoes 
for eating (cf. Kona-fubuki is the major variety of potatoes for processing). 
   The amount of potato produced in Imakane Town is not so large as compared to 
municipalities in Tokachi sub-prefecture, but the potatoes are popular for 
their quality (see Kutchan Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for Danshaku 
potatoes; see Assabu in Hiyama for May Queen potatoes).
   I heard like this from a former high school teacher; ``Potatoes are 
cultivated after potatoes in Dô-nan (south Hokkaidô).''
   Rotation of several crops including potatoes are better than the double 
cropping of potatoes, because nora-imo (stray potatoes, which are the rest of 
the former harvest) give a bad impact on the next cultivation. In Tokachi 
sub-prefecture, stray potatoes are killed by the cold temperature, and farmers 
manage larger plots of land for crop rotation (see Shihoro Town in Tokachi). 
   #6 The width of Pirika Dam in Imakane is 1480m. It is the longest concrete 
dam in the country. 
   The dam was constructed between 1975 and 1991 at the confluence of the 
rivers of Shiribeshi-toshibetsu, Pirikabetsu, and Chûshibetsu. The water of the 
dam lake is used for power generation, irrigation, and flood control. Driftwood 
from the dam lake is distributed free of charge for personal use such as for 
wood stoves and gardening. 
   Kur Plaza Pirika is located in front of the dam. The facility includes a hot 
spring, a ski resort, and a restaurant. Its specialty is dam curry, in which 
the rice blocks the curry.
   In the upstream of the Pirikabetsu River, there is Okupirika hot spring 
along Prefectural Route 999. The name Pirikabetsu means a beautiful river in 
Ainu. The Kanji characters for Pirika [美利河] also means ``beautiful, 
profitable, river''.
