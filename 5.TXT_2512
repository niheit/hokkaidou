When I worked for Hokkaidou University from 2010 to 2021, I guided many 
bus excursions.  This file is made based on my excursion notes at the 
time.  (by T. Nihei)

LOCATION

Oshima [o-shi-ma] [\u6E21\u5CF6] is a sub-prefecture (``sougou-shinkou-
kyoku'') in south Hokkaidou (``dou-nan'').  Oshima is located in the 
south the Oshima Peninsula.  The area faces Uchiura Bay (Volcano Bay), 
Tsugaru Strait, and the Sea of Japan.  #1
	The temperature is high, compared to other areas in Hokkaidou. 
By Koeppen's climate classification, the coast of Matsumae Town is 
classified as Cfa (humid subtropical), whereas most areas in Hokkaidou 
is classified as Dfb (humid continental, cool summer).
	In the case of Hakodate City, the mean annual temperature is
9.1 degrees Celsius (average from 1981 to 2010), the mean annual 
precipitation is 1,152 millimeters, and the mean annual snowfall is 381 
centimeters.  #2

NAME

The name ``Oshima'' is Japanese. The pronunciation of the Kanji 
characters ``Watari-shima [\u6E21\u5CF6]'' changed to Oshima. The name 
``Watari-shima'' means ``across, island.''
	In the mid 15th century, forts (``tate'') were established by 
Japanese people.  In the Edo era (17th to 19th centuries), the area was 
ruled by the Matsumae Domain and sometimes by the Tokugawa Shogunate. 
	[See Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the forts.  
See Matsumae Town and Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for 
history in the Edo era.]

HISTORY

After the Meiji period, in 1869 (Meiji 2), Oshima country (Oshima-no-
kuni [\u6E21\u5CF6\u56FD]) was established.  The Hokkaidou Development 
Commission (Kaitaku-shi) was established in Hakodate.  In 1871 (Meiji 
4), the Hokkaidou Development Commission moved to Sapporo.  The 
Hakodate office became a branch.
	In 1879 (Meiji 12), administrative offices for counties (``gun-
yakusho [\u90E1\u5F79\u6240]'') were established.  Administrative 
offices for villages and towns (``kochou-yakuba'') were established. 
(Administrative offices before this year were a continuation of 
village chief [``kochou''] and town chief [``kochou''] from the Edo 
era.)
	In 1882 (Meiji 15), the Hokkaidou Development Commission was 
abolished.  Prefectures of Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro were 
established.  In 1886 (Meiji 19), the three prefectures were abolished. 
Hokkaidou Prefecture Office (Hokkaidou-chou) was established.
	In 1897 (Meiji 30), administrative offices for counties were 
abolished.  In the area what is now Oshihma, three sub-prefectures
(``shichou [\u652F\u5E81]'') were established.  Those were Hakodate, 
Kameda, and Matsumae.
	In 1899 (Meiji 32), Hakodate sub-prefecture merged Kameda sub-
prefecture.  In 1903 (Meiji 36), Hakodate sub-prefecture merged 
Matsumae sub-prefecture.  Municipalities were renovated drastically in 
the Meiji period.
	In 1922 (Taishou 11), Hakodate sub-prefecture was renamed 
Oshima sub-prefecture.  In 2010, Oshima General Sub-prefectural Bureau 
(Oshima-sougou-shinkou-kyoku) was established.

MUNICIPALITY

These are municipalities in Oshima sub-prefecture; (1) Hakodate City 
279,127 (population in 2010, third largest in Hokkaidou), (2) Hokuto 
City 48,032, (3) Nanae Town 28,453, (4) Yakumo Town 18,896, (5) Mori 
Town 17,859, (6) Matsumae Town 8,748, (7) Oshamanbe Town 6,386, 
	(continued) --> (8) Kikonai Town 5,386, (9) Fukushima Town 
5,114, (10) Shiriuchi Town 5,074, and (11) Shikabe Town 4,767. The sub-
prefectural bureau is located in Hakodate City.

NOTE
 
#1  Volcano Bay is called Funka-wan in Japanese.  The name ``Volcano 
Bay'' was named in 1796 by William Robert Broughton.  He was a British 
naval officer.  At the time, volcanoes erupted around the bay.
	Some students asked me if Volcano Bay is a caldera.  It is not 
a caldera, although its round shape resembles a caldera.  There is no 
caldera as large as this size in the country.  
	The largest caldera in the country is Kussharo Caldera in 
Hokkaidou.  It is located in Teshikaga Town in Kushiro sub-prefecture. 
When I was in elementary school, I heard that the world largest caldera 
ws Aso Caldera in Kumamoto Prefecture.  Today, the world largest 
caldera is located in Indonesia.
 
#2  In the case of Tokyo (Chiyoda Ward, the representative data of 
Japan), the mean annual temperature is 15.4 degrees Celsius (average 
from 1981 to 2010) and the mean annual rainfall is 1,529 millimeters. 
The climate of Tokyo is classified as Cfa (humid subtropical) by 
Koeppen's climate classification.
	As for the coldest month, the mean temperature of Tokyo is 5.2 
degrees Celsius in January.  The mean temperature of Hakodate is -2.6 
degrees Celsius in January.  As for the hottest month, the mean 
temperature of Tokyo is 26.4 degrees Celsius in August.  The mean 
temperature of Hakodate is 22.0 degrees Celsius in August.
	In Hokkadou, it gets cold after Obon (15th August).  In Tokyo, 
it finally gets cooler after the equinox (23rd September).

LOCATION

Hiyama [hi-ya-ma] [\u6A9C\u5C71] is a sub-prefecture (``shinkou-
kyoku'') in south Hokkaidou (``dou-nan'').  Hiyama is located in the 
west of the Oshima Peninsula.  It faces the Sea of Japan.  The area is 
divided into north and south.  #1
 	Climate in Hiyama is mild compared to other areas in Hokkaidou. 
The warm Tsushima Current in the Sea of Japan influences.  In winter, 
it is windy due to the monsoon that blows from the continent.
	According to Koeppen's climate classification, most of the 
areas in Hiyama are classified as Dfb (humid continental, cool summer). 
The coast of Esashi Town and the coast of Okushiri island are 
classified as Cfa (humid subtropical).  The other coasts are classified 
as Cfb (temperate oceanic).  The population is distributed along the 
coast.
	In the case of Esashi Town, the mean annual temperature is 10.1 
degrees Celsius (average from 1981 to 2010), the mean annual 
precipitation is 1,197 millimeters, and the mean snowfall is 330 
centimeters.  #2

NAME

The name ``Hiyama'' is Japanese. ``Hi-yama'' means ``cypress 
[sa'i-pruhs], mountain.''  The name was suggested by Takeshirou 
Matsuura in the beginning of the Meiji period.  Takeshirou Matsuura 
explored Ezo (now Hokkaidou) during the Edo era.  #3
	There used to be natural forests of Hiba trees in Hiyama. 
(Hiba is a kind of cypress.)  After the late 17th century, during the 
Edo era, the Matsumae Domain felled Hiba trees in the area what is now 
Hiyama sub-prefecture.  #4
	Japanese immigration has a long history.  In the mid 15th 
century, the Andou clan built 12 forts in what is now Hiayama and 
Oshima sub-prefectures.  In the Edo era, the south part of Hiyama was 
ruled by the Matsumae Domain.  (The area was also ruled by the Tokugawa 
Shogunate for a time.)  #5
	After the Meiji period, in 1869 (Meiji 2), the area was 
included in Oshima-no-kuni (Oshima country [\u6E21\u5CF6\u56FD]) and 
Shiribeshi-no-kuni (Shiribeshi country [\u5F8C\u5FD7\u56FD]).  In 1872 
(Meiji 5), Esashi branch of the Hokkaidou Development Commission was 
established.
	In 1897 (Meiji 30), Hiyama sub-prefecture (Hiyama-shichou 
[\u6A9C\u5C71 \u652F\u5E81] was established. In 2010, Hiyama Sub-
prefectural Bureau (Hiyama-shinkou-kyoku) was established.

MUNICIPALITY

These are municipalities in Hiyama; (1) Setana Town 9,590 (population 
in 2010), (2) Esashi Town 9,004, (3) Imakane Town 6,186, (4) Kaminokuni 
Town 5,428, (5) Assabu Town 4,409, (6) Otobe Town 4,408, and (7) 
Okushiri Town 3,033.  The sub-prefectural bureau is located in Esashi 
Town.
	The poplation of Hiyama is the smallest of all the sub-
prefectures.  All municipalities in Hiyama are designated as 
depopulated areas (``kaso-chiiki'').

NOTE
  
#1  Hiyama sub-prefecture is devided into two parts, the north and 
the south.  In the middle part, there was Kumaishi Town that was merged 
to Yakumo Town in Oshima sub-prefecture.  
	Oshima sub-prefecture is located on the Pacific Ocean side.  
Hiyama sub-prefecture is located on the Sea of Japal side.  There were 
many reasons for the merger across sub-prefectures.

#2  In the case of Tokyo (Chiyoda Ward; the representative data of 
Japan), the mean annual temperature is 15.4 degrees Celsius (average 
from 1981 to 2010) and the mean annual rainfall is 1,529 millimeters. 
The climate of Tokyo is classified as Cfa (humid subtropical) by 
Koeppen's climate classification.
	As for the coldest month, the mean temperature of Tokyo is 5.2 
degrees Celsius in January.  The mean temperature of Esashi is -0.8 
degrees Celsius in January.  As for the hottest month, the mean 
temperature of Tokyo is 26.4 degrees Celsius in August.  The mean 
temperature of Esashi is 22.6 degrees Celsius in August.
  
#3  Takeshirou Matsuura (1818-1888) was an explorer of Ezo (old 
Hokkaidou) in the Edo era.  He documented place names in Ezo island and 
published the book ``Ezochi-gunmei-no-gui-torishirabe-sho (Ezo region 
county name survey report) [\u8766\u5937\u5730\u90E1\u540D\u4E4B\u5100
\u53D6\u8ABF\u66F8].''
	The book was submitted to the Meiji government in 1869 (Meiji 
2).  The government decided place names in Ezo (now Hokkaidou). 
``Hiyama'' was the one of them.
	Before the Edo era, in the 15th century, the Andou clan 
migrated to Ezo and built 12 forts.  They returned to thier home land, 
which was located in what is now the Touhoku region.  In their home 
land, the Andou clan built Hiyama Castle, which was located in what is 
now Akita Prefecture.
	As for the name ``Hiyama,'' Takeshirou Matsuura may have 
adopted the name of the old castle that was built by the Andou clan in 
their home land.
	[See Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the former 12 
forts.]
 
#4  Regarding the name ``Hi-yama (cypress mountain),'' in Honshuu 
island, cypress trees usually means Hinoki trees.  In Hokkaidou and 
Aomori prefectures, cypress trees  means ``Hiba.''
	Houryuuji Temple is the oldest wooden building in the country. 
It was rebuilt in 670.  The temple is made of Hinoki trees. Temple 
carpenters (``miya-daiku'') consider Hinoki is the best wood for 
construction (Nihei lab 2024-2025a).
	[See Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the oldest 
building in Hokkaidou.]
	The another name of Hiba trees is Hinoki-asunaro.  It means 
``tomorrow, it will be Hinoki trees'' in Japanese.  This means that the 
wood of Hiba is inferior to Hinoki.  Actually, the wood of Hiba is also 
good.
	The leaves of Hiba are denser than Hinoki.  Hiba grows slower 
than trees of Hinoki, Sugui (ceder), and Todo-matsu (fir).  Hiba grows 
even on shady north slopes and moist soils along the coast.  It grows 
slowy and steadily.
	The wood of Hiba has a tight grain and is resistant to 
moisture.  The wood is less likely to warp and less likely to rot.  It 
was used for pillars, bathtubs, boats, bridges, and cutting boards.
	The natural forests of Hiba in Hiyama sub-prefecture were said 
``very good trees from the shoreline.''  The natural forests were 
disappeared for felling and fires during the Edo era.
	Today, two natural forests are preserved in remote mountains.  
They have been designated as National Natural Monuments.
	[See Assabu Town and Esashi Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for 
cypress felling.]
 
#5  Masao Kanamori, who is a high school teacher, says; ``Hiyama's 
culture is different from other parts of Hokkaidou.  You can see it 
when you visit festivals.''

LOCATION

Matsumae [ma-tsu-ma-e] [\u677E\u524D] is a town in Oshima sub-
prefecture, south Hokkaidou (``dou-nan'').  The area is located in the 
southwest of the Oshima Peninsula.  This part of the Oshima Peninsula 
is called the Matsumae Peninsula.
	Matsumae is the southernmost municipality in Hokkaidou.  The 
area faces the Tsugaru Strait and the Sea of Japan.  It includes 
Ooshima island and Kojima island on the Sea of Japan.  #1  #2
 	The area is mountainous.  Forests occupy 87 percent. Rivers 
are short.  Mt. Dai-sen-guen (1,072 meters) stands to the north.  In 
the past, there was a gold mine in Mt. Dai-sen-guen.
	[See Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the gold 
miners in Mt. Dai-sen-guen.]
	The climate along the coast is humid subtropical.  It is 
classified as ``Cfa'' by Koeppen's climate classification. ``Cfa'' 
means ``humid subtropical.''  Almost all other parts of Hokkaidou are 
classified as ``Dfb,'' which means ``humid continental and cool 
summer.''
	Camellia trees and Mousou-dake bamboos grow under the warm 
climate of Matsumae Town.  Camellia is a forever-green broad-leaved 
tree.  It is a family of tea tree.  Mousou-dake is a large kind of 
bamboo.  In Hokkaidou, generally, the word ``bamboo'' signifies 
``bamboo grass (`sasa').''  

NAME

The name ``Matsumae'' comes from ``mat-oma-i'' in Ainu language.  It 
means ``woman, live, place.''  It signified the uniqueness of the place 
where Japanese women lived.  The etymology of the name is similar to 
Kuromatsunai Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture.
	In Ezo (old Hokkaidou), most Japanese people returned to their 
homelands in winter.  The name ``Matsumae'' signified that the place 
was the territory of Japanese people.  They could give birth 
(reproduce) in the place.

HISTORY

In 720, the name ``Watari-shima-tsugaru-tsu [\u6E21\u5CF6\u6D25\u8EFD
\u6D25]'' was recorded.  It meant a port (``tsu'') between Watari-shima 
(now Hokkaidou Prefecture) and Tsugaru (now Aomori Prefecture).  It 
signified what is now the Port of Matsumae.
	In the 14th century, the name ``Matouma-inu [\u4E07\u5802
\u5B87\u6E80\u4F0A\u72AC]'' was recorded.  From the 13th to 15th 
centuries, the Andou clan came from Tsugaru (now Aomori Prefecture).
They built 12 forts in what is now south Hokkaidou.  They traded with 
Ainu people.
	In 1457, Koshamain's War happened.  Koshamain was a chief of 
Ainu.  In the war, the Ainu forces destroyed 10 forts out of the 12 
forts, which the the Andou clan built.  #3
	[See Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the former 12 
forts and Koshamain's War.]
 	During the Edo era, Matsumae was the capital of the Matsumae 
Domain.  It was the northernmost castle town in Japan.  The Matsumae 
Domain managed major ports in Ezo (old Hokkaidou), namely, Matsumae, 
Esashi, and Hakodate.  Those ports were gateways to Ezo.  ``Matsmai'' 
in Moby Dick (a novel) means Hokkaidou.
 	In the end of the Edo era, in 1868, the Matsumae Domain seceded 
from the Tokugawa Shogunate.  They supported the new Meiji government.  
In the beginning of the Meiji period, the Boshin War happened.  The 
former Tokugawa Shogunate forces landed Ezo and captured Fukuyama 
Castle and the capital of the Matsumae Domain. (Another name of 
Fukuyama Castle is Matsumae Castle.)
	In 1869 (Meiji 2), the Meiji government forces recaptured 
Fukuyama Castle.  They advanced to Hakodate, defeated the former 
Tokugawa Shogunate, and ended the Boshin War.  After the war, the 
Matsumae Domain was renamed the Tate Domain.  It was named after Tate 
Castle in what is now Assabu Town.
	[See Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the Boshin War. 
See Assabu Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for Tate Castle.]
 	In 1871 (Meiji 4), the Tate Domain was abolished and Aomori 
Prefecture governed the southern part of Hokkaidou.  In 1872 (Meiji 5), 
Matsumae branch of the Hokkaidou Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi) 
was established.
	In 1881 (Meiji 14), the administrative office of Matsumae 
county (Matsumae-gun-yakusho) was established.  Matsumae branch of the 
Hokkaidou Development Commission was abolished.  In 1897 (Meiji 30), 
Matsumae sub-prefecture was established.  The administrative office of 
Matsumae county was abolished.
	In 1900 (Meiji 33), Fukuyama [\u798F\u5C71] Town (1st-class 
municipality) was established.  At the time, 34 towns in the built-up 
area of Matsumae were merged. (The area of the towns in a built-up area 
are small.  They were established in the Edo era.)  #4
	In 1903 (Meiji 36), Hakodate sub-prefecture merged Matsumae 
sub-prefecture.  In 1915 (Taishou 4), Ooshima [\u5927\u5CF6] Village 
(2nd-class municipality) was established by the merger of three 
villages; Eramachi [\u6C5F\u826F\u753A], Haraguchi [\u539F\u53E3], and 
Kiyobe [\u6E05\u90E8].  (Ooshima village was not Ooshima island.)
	In 1923 (Taishou 12), Kojima [\u5C0F\u5CF6] Village (2nd-class 
municipality) was established by the merger of five villages; Nebuta 
[\u6839\u90E8\u7530], Akagami [\u8D64\u795E], Satsumae [\u672D\u524D], 
Mogusa [\u8302\u8349], and Utari [\u96E8\u5782].  (Kojima village was 
not in Kojima island.)
	In the same year, Oosawa [\u5927\u6CA2] Village (2nd-class 
municipality) was established by the merger of four villages; Oosawa, 
Araya [\u8352\u8C37], Sumiyaki-zawa [\u70AD\u713C\u6CA2], and Kami-
oyobe [\u4E0A\u53CA\u90E8].  #5
	In 1940 (Shouwa 15), Fukuyama Town was renamed Matsumae Town. 
In 1954 (Shouwa 29), Matsumae Town merged the villages of Ooshima, 
Kojima, and Oosawa.

TOWN HALL, TRAFFIC

The town hall of Matsumae and Matsumae Castle (Fukuyama Castle) are 
located near the mouth of the Oomatsumae River.  National Route 228 
(Fukuyama-kaidou or Matsumae-kokudou) passes there.  ``Fukuyama-
kaidou'' was an old trail that connected Matsumae and Hakodate in the 
Edo era.  #6
	[See Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for Fukuyama-
kaidou.]
 	In the past, the Matsumae Line run.  The railroad connected 
Kikonai Town and Matsumae Town.  The terminal was Matsumae Station.  
The population of Matsumae peaked at 20,072 in 1955.  #7

INDUSTRY, CULTURE

Distinctive industries in Matsumae are fishery, food processing (mainly 
Surume and Matsumae-zuke), and sightseeing.  STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE 
= fodder 192 hectares in 2015, pasture 154, and paddy rice X 
(concealed); dairy cows - (zero) in 2015.  STATISTICS OF FISHERIES = 
squid (flying squid 540 tons in 2017, other squid 154), snow crabs 442, 
	(continued) --> atka mackerel 334, sea urchins 126, tuna 92, 
Pacific cod 61, Konbu kelp (cultured) 57, octopus 49, sharks 47, olive 
flounder 6, shrimp/prawns 5, walleye pollock 4, abalone (cultured) 2, 
yellowtail 1, herring -, other fish 29+X, and other marine animals 11.
#8
	As for sightseeing, Matsumae Castle is famous for cherry 
blossoms.  In the castle, there is a botanical garden with 10,000 
cherry trees of 250 varieties.  #9
	There are many temples in Matsumae, as it was a castle town.  
In the past, monks were like civil servants.  They could read and 
write.  Today, Tourists observe buildings and gardens in temples. 
 
NOTE
 
#1  The southernmost of Hokkaidou island is Cape Shirakami.  It is 
located along National Route 228 in Matsumae Town.  The latitude is 41 
degrees 23.87 minutes north.  The longitude is 140 degrees 11.86 
minutes east.
 	If small islands are counted, the southernmost of Hokkaidou 
Prefecture is Kojima island.  Kojima island is also called Matsumae-
kojima or Oshima-kojima.  It is an uninhabited island.
	Ooshima island is the largest uninhabited island in the 
country.  The area is 9.7 square kilometers. Ooshima island is also 
called Matsumae-ooshima or Oshima-ooshima.
	 Ooshima island is a volcano.  It erupted in 1741 and caused 
tidal waves. The tidal waves killed 1,467 people in the Matsumae 
Domain and 566 people in the Tsugaru Domain.  (During the Edo era, the 
Matsumae Domain ruled the south of Hokkaidou Prefecture.  The Tsugaru 
Domain ruled the west of Aomori Prefecture.)
	Tourists cannot land Ooshima island and Kojima island.  
Shelters for fishing boats only exist in these islands. These islands 
are breeding grounds of seabirds such as Umigarasu (murre) and 
Oomizunagi-dori (Streaked shearwater).

#2  As for the Tsugaru Strait, the distance between the Matsumae 
Peninsula and Tsugaru Peninsula (Aomori Prefectrue) is 19.5 kilometers. 
It is the distance between Cape Shirakami in Matsumae Town and Cape 
Tappi-zaki in Sotogahama Town. 
	The distance between the Kameda Peninsula and the Shimokita 
Peninsula (Aomori Prefectrue) is 19.0 kilometers.  It is the distance 
between Cape Shiokubi in the former Toi Town (now Hakodate City) and 
Cape Ooma in Ooma Town.
	The Seikan Tunnel was constructed between the Matsumae Peninsula
and Tsugaru Peninsula.  The water is shallower, although the distance 
is longer.
	[See Hakaodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the Tsugaru 
Strait.]
 
#3  In 1457, the warlord Nobuhiro Takeda ended the Koshamain's War. 
Nobuhiro Takeda was a vassal of the Andou clan.  Around 1549, his 
great-grandson, Suehiro Kakizaki, made peace with Ainu chiefs.
	[See Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for Nobuhiro 
Takeda.] 
	In 1593, Yoshihiro Kakizaki, who was the son of Suehiro 
Kakizaki, became independent from the Andou clan.  He was able to ask 
Hideyoshi Toyotomi for the land of Ezo (now Hokkaidou).  (Hideyoshi 
Toyotomi was the ruler during the Warring State era.)
	The meeting between Hideyoshi Toyotomi and Yoshihiro Kakizaki 
was arranged by the Maeda clan. The Maeda clan was the ruler of the 
Kaga Domain (now Ishikawa Prefecture).
	In 1598, Hideyoshi Toyotomi died. In 1599, Yoshihiro Kakizaki 
gave Ezo maps to Ieyasu Tokugawa, who founded the Tokugawa Shogunate. 
Maps were important for governing lands during the Warring States era. 
Giving maps meant obedience.
	In 1604, in the Edo era, the Tokugawa Shogunate appointed 
Yoshihiro Kakizaki as the lord of the Matsumae Domain. Yoshihiro 
Kakizaki changed his family name from Kakizaki to Matsumae.
	There is a rummer that the name ``Matsu-mae'' comes from 
Matsudaira (Ieyasu Tokugawa's old family name) and the Maeda clan.
	(The Tokugawa Shogunate continued from 1903 to 1867. The 
founder Ieyasu Tokugawa moved the capital from Kyouto to Edo [now 
Tokyo].)
 
#4  In Hokkaidou, 1st-class (``ikkyuu'') municipalities and 2nd-class 
(``nikyuu'') municipalities were designated from 1899 to 1943.  The 
Hokkaidou government subsidized 2nd-class municipalities.  It was a 
pioneering period.
 
#5   As for the former Sumiyaki-zawa village, the name ``Sumi-yaki-
zawa'' means ``charcoal, burn, stream'' in Japanese.
	Sei Itou was a novelist who was born in Sumiyaki-zawa village.  
He was influenced by James Joyce, an Irish novelist.  He was one of the 
translators of Ulysses.  The Japanese translation of Ulysses was 
published from 1931 to 1933.)
	[See Otaru City in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for Sei Itou.]
	James Joyce published his novels in English.  He did not use 
his native language Celtic in his work.  He died in Zurich.  Not only 
James Joyce but also Jonathan Swift, William Butler Yeats, and Oscar 
Wild were from Ireland and published their work in English.  They had 
the guts.

#6  Fukuyama Castle is the former name of Matsumae Castle.  The castle 
was designated as a national treasure of Japan.  The castle burned down 
in 1949.
	Currently, the only national treasure in Hokkaidou is a clay 
figurine.  It was dug out from a potato field.
	[See Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the national 
treasure.]

#7  Matsumae Town is a sister city with Oumi-hachiman City in Shiga 
Prefecture and Yanagawa Town (now Date City) in Fukushima Prefecture. 
The reasons date back to the Edo era;
	Merchants from Oumi-hachiman were called Hachiman-shounin. 
They traded in Ezo using Kitamae-bune (North-bound ship).  They 
based in the castle town of Matsumae.  They developed herring fishing 
grounds.  (Hachiman-shounin was included in Oumi-shounin [Oumi 
merchants].)
	Regarding Yanagawa, in 1807, the Tokugawa Shogunate directly 
ruled Ezo to prevent Russian southward movement.  The Mastumae Domain's 
attitude towards the Russians was judged to be bad.  The vassals of 
Matsumae Domain were forced to moved to Yanagawa. 
	Half of the vassals became ``rounin'' (jobless samurai).  They 
lived in hardship for 14 years until the Matsumae Domain was returned 
to Ezo in 1821.

#8  Dried flying squid is called ``surume.''  Matsumae Town and 
neighboring Fukushima Town are the largest producers of dried flying 
squid in the country.
	 The tonnages of dried flying squid from those towns account 
for 80 percent of the national share.  In the late Meiji period (about 
100 years ago), herring fishing decreased and flying squid fishing 
prospered.
	In the past, fishers processed flying squid into ``surume'' 
(dried flying squid).  As catches increased, after the 1970s, local 
companies started processing flying squid.  ]By Matsumae Town's website 
``History of Matsumae Surume,'' last accessed May 2019.]
	Matsumae-zuke is pickles made with Konbu kelp, dried flying 
squid, and herring roe.  A variety of Matsumae-zuke are sold at 
``Dosanko Plaza,'' a souvenir shop in Sapporo Station.
	In the past, when herring catches were poor, Matsumae-zuke 
without herring roe was sold.

#9  These are famous cherry blossom sites in Hokkaidou; (1) Matsumae 
Castle (in Matsumae Town, Oshima sub-prefecture), (2) Go-ryou-kaku 
Castle (in Hakodate City, Oshima sub-prefecture), (3) Rows of cherry 
trees that lead to Noboribetsu Hot Spring (in Noboribetsu City, Iburi 
sub-prefecture), 
	(continued) --> (4) Nijikken Road in Shizunai (in what is now 
Shin-hidaka Town, Hidaka sub-prefecture), and (5) Shiokari Pass (in 
Wassamu Town in Kamikawa sub-prefecture).
	These are cherry varieties and cherry blossom sites; (1) 
Yaezakura (double-flowered cherry) and many other varieties including 
Somei-yoshino in Matsumae Castle, (2) Somei-yoshino in Go-ryou-kaku 
Castle, (3) and Ezo-yamazakura (Hokkaidou mountain cherry) in Shizunai.
	The best time to see cherry blossoms varies year by year. 
Generally, it is from late April to mid May in Matsumae Town and from 
early to mid May in Shizunai.
	One of the oldest Somei-yoshino trees in the country exists at 
Matsumae Castle.  It was planted in 1882 (Meiji 15).
	Somei-yoshino is a famous cherry variety in the country.  It 
was bred in Somei village near Edo (now the center of Tokyo) in the end 
of the Edo era.  Somei village was located near present-day Ikebukuro.
	Somei-yoshino was named after Mt. Yoshino, a famous cherry 
blossom site in Nara Prefecture.  The cherries in Mt. Yoshino are 
mountain cherries.
	Somei-yoshino trees are clones. If the soil and climate are the 
same, they grow in the same way.  The height, trunk diameter, twisted 
trunk, and blooming period are similar.  Somei-yoshino trees are used 
as an indicator for the season of cherry blossom. 
	Making plant clones are easier than animal clones.  Clones are 
more alike than siblings.  Plant clones are the predecessors of today's 
digital society (Nihei lab 2023-2025b).

NAME

The name ``Fukushima'' is Japanese.  ``Fuku-shima'' means 
``lucky, island.''  It is a good-luck name that was given by an oracle 
from Tsukizaki Shrine in 1624.  #1  #2

HISTORY

The first Japanese immigrants to Ezo (now Hokkaidou) came from Ooshuu 
(now Touhoku region) in 1189.  They were vassals of the Fujiwara clan 
that were defeated by Yoritomo Minamoto.  They lived in what is now 
Yoshioka district, Fukushima Town.  (Yoritomo Minamoto established the 
Kamakura Shogunate after he conquered Ooshuu.)  
	In the mid 15th century, there was a fort called Onnai-date in 
Yoshioka district.  The fort was destroyed by the Ainu forces during 
Koshamain's War.
	[See Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for Koshamain's 
war.]
	In the Edo era, this area was ruled by the Matsumae Domain. 
Around 1617, a gold mine opened in Mt. Dai-sen-guen.  The gold miners 
were Catholic.  #3
 	In the beginning of the Meiji period, this area belonged to the 
Tate Domain.  (The Matsumae domain was renamed the Tate Domain.)
	[See Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the Tate 
Domain.]
	In 1879 (Meiji 12), two administrative offices (``kochou-
yakuba'') were established; one was for Fukushima village and Shirafu 
[\u767D\u7B26] village; one was for Yoshioka [\u5409\u5CA1] village, 
Reihige [\u793C\u9AED] village, and Miyanouta [\u5BAE\u6B4C] village.
 	In 1900 (Meiji 33), Fukushima Village (1st-class municipality) 
was established by the merger of Fukushima village and Shirafu village. 
	[See the note of Matsumae Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class 
municipalities.]
	In 1902 (Meiji 35), Yoshioka Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established by the merger of Yoshioka, Reihige, and Miyanouta 
villages.  In 1944 (Shouwa 19), Fukushima Town was established.  In 
1955 (Shouwa 30), Fukushima Town and Yoshioka Village were merged.
 	
TOWN HALL, TRAFFIC

The town hall of Fukushima is located near the mouth of the Fukushima 
River.  National Route 228 (Fukuyama-kaidou) runs.  #4
 	In the past, the Matsumae Line ran.  It connected Matsumae 
Station in Matsumae Town and Kikonai Station in Kikonai Town.  There 
was Yoshioka-kaitei Station on the Kaikyou Line.  It was an undersea 
station in the undersea Seikan Tunnel.  #5

INDUSTRY

Distinctive industries in Fukushima are fishery and forestry. 
STATISTICS OF AGRICULTIRE = paddy rice X (concealed) in 2015; dairy 
cows - (zero) in 2015.  STATISTICS OF FISHERIES = squid (flying squid 
895 tons in 2017, other squid 26), sea urchins 85, tuna 66, octopus 48, 
	(continud) --> seaweed (Konbu kelp 24, other seaweed 10), olive 
flounder 6, sea trout 6, atka mackerel 6, right-eye flounder 1, abalone 
1, herring 0, other fish 10, and other marine animals 3. 
	Fishing ports are located in Fukushima, Yoshioka, Shirafu, and 
Urawa.  The catch of squid accounts for about 80 percent of the 
fishery.  Fukushima and neighboring Matsumae are the leading producers 
of ``surume'' (dried flying squid) in the country.
	[See Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for ``surume.'']
	As for forestry, the main trees are cedar [si'-dar], fir (Todo-
matsu), and spruce (Ezo-matsu).  The ceder is sold under the trade-name 
Dou-nan-sugui (South Hokkaidou Cedar).  #6
	Sightseeing destinations include Seikan Tunnel Memorial Hall, 
Tadataka Inou Hokkaidou Survey Memorial Park, and Yokozuna Chiyo-no-
Yama and Chiyo-no-Fuji Memorial Hall.  ``Yokozuna'' means the champions 
of Sumou wrestling.
	[See Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for Tadataka 
Inou.]
	The country sign (gateway sign) of Fukushima Town features a 
squid Sumou wrestler.  The name of the roadside station is Yokozuna-no-
sato, which means the hometown of Sumou champions.
 
NOTE

#1  According to ``Fukushima Town History (Fukushima-chou-shi) Volume 
2'' published in 1995, ``Once upon a time, Orikanai village was on the 
verge of being abandoned, for a large fire and poor fishing.  At the 
time, there was an oracle from Tsukisaki Shrine.  It said, `The name 
Orikanai must be changed to Fukushima.'
	The name ``Fuku-shima'' may have referred to Fuku-yama, which 
was a neighboring castle town.  ``Fuku-shima'' means ``lucky, island'' 
and ``Fuku-yama'' means ``lucky, mountain.''  Fukuyama was the former 
name of Matsumae Town.
	As for the original place name ``Orikanai,'' it comes from 
``horka-nay'' in Ainu language.  It means ``reverse, river.''  It 
signified the Fukushima River.  Seawater entered the estuary at high 
tide.  The etymology is the same as Horokanai Town in Kamikawa sub-
prefecture.

#2  These are old shrines in Fukushima Town; (1) Tsukisaki Shrine, 
reconstructed in 1492, (2) Fukushima Daijinguu Shrine, reconstructed in 
1573, (3) Shirafu Daijinguu Shrine, established in 1655 by the Matsumae 
Domain, and (4) Kamaya Shrine, established in 1772.
	Shirafu Daijinguu Shirine preserves the traditional dance 
``Shirafu-arauma-odori (Shirafu, wild horse, dance).''  The dance 
represented the power of the Matsumae Domain.  It has been designated 
as an Intangible Cultural Property (Mukei-bunka-zai).
	Kamaya Shrine is located in Shiogama district.  ``Shio-gama'' 
is Japanese, which means ``salt, pot.''  The name was derived from 
the production of salt for sardine fishing.

#3  The mountain's name ``Dai-sen-guen'' is Japanese.  It means 
``large, thousand, houses.''  It signified that there were 1,000 houses 
of gold miners.  During the Edo era, the Tokugawa Shogunate banned 
Christianity, however, the regulation was loose in Ezo island, because 
the island was considered as an outer land (``gaichi''). 
	In 1637, Christians revolted in Kyuushuu island.  In 1939, 
Christians in Ezo island were executed.  At the site of the gold mine 
in Mt. Dai-sen-guen, there is an inscription that reads ``Christian 
martyrdom [ma'r-tar-dam].''
 
#4  As for Fukuyama-kaidou (Fukuyama trail), the name ``Fukuyama'' 
means the former castle town of the Matsumae Domain.  The Fukuyama-
kaidou connected Fukuyama Castle (Matsume Castle) and the Port of 
Hakodate.  It was an old trail traveled by Matsumae Domain's samurai.  
The distance was 100 kilometers.
	Fukuyama-kaidou was located in Ezo (now Hokkaidou Prefecture). 
Matsumae-kaidou was located in Tsugaru (now Aomori Prefecture).
	[See Hokuto City in Oshima sub-prefecture for Matsumae-kaidou.]

#5  The Seikan Tunnel is an undersea railway tunnel.  The length is 54 
kilometers.  (Channel Tunnel [Le tunnel sous la Mance] between England 
and France is 50 kilometers.  Gotthard Base Tunnel in Switzerland is 
57 kilometers.)  Cf. The total length of tunnels in a coal mine 
reached 200 kilometers.
	[See Akabira City in Sorachi sub-prefecture for the coal 
mining.]
	Yoshioka-kaitei Station in Fukushima Town was built at 150 
meters below sea level.  The station was used for sightseeing and the 
maintenance of the undersea tunnel.  The station was closed in 2006 and 
demolished in 2014. 
 	Yoshioka district was the base for the construction of the 
undersea Seikan Tunnel.  It was constructed between 1961 and 1988. 
Yoshioka district flourished during the construction of the tunnel.  
	[See Kikonai Town and Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture 
for the undersea tunnel.]

#6  Cedar trees are not common in Hokkaidou.  Cedar pollen fever is 
rare in the island.  However, white birch (``Shira-kanba'') and alder 
(``Han-no-ki'') cause pollen fever in Hokkaidou.  I did not hear about 
pollen fever when I was a child during the 1970s.  Cedar trees were 
young at the time. 
	Cedar trees grow on wet land.  Farmers in Honshuu island 
planted cedar trees on abandoned rice paddies near valley heads.  
During the high economic growth period, between the late 1960s and the 
early 1970s, farm successors left the countryside.  Land use was 
changed from agricultural to forest.  Taxes were reduced.

LOCATION

Shiriuchi [shi-ri-u-chi] [\u77E5\u5185] is a town in Oshima sub-
prefecture, south Hokkaidou (``dou-nan'').  Shiriuchi is located in the 
southwest of the Oshima Peninsula.  This part of the Oshima Peninsula 
is called the Matsumae Peninsula.  The area of Shiriuchi faces the 
Tsugaru Strait to the east.  Forests cover 87 percent of the area.

NAME

The name ``Shiriuchi`` comes from ``cir-ot-i'' in Ainu language.  It 
means ``bird, exist, place.''  It signified the Shiriuchi River.  In 
the Edo era, Shiriuchi was a hunting ground for hawks and falcons.  
Young hawks and falcons were caught and shipped to Edo (now Tokyo) for 
falconry.  #1

HISTORY

In 1205, the feudal lord of Kai Province (now Yamanashi Prefecture) 
started gold dust gathering along the Shiriuchi River.  It was an order 
from the Kamakura Shogunate.
	In the 15th century, there was a fort called Wakimoto-date [da-
te].  It was one of the 12 forts built by the Andou clan.  The Andou 
clan came from Tsugaru (now Aomori Prefecture).  During the Edo era, 
the area what is now Shiriuchi was ruled by the Matsumae Domain.  #2
	After the Meiji period, in 1871 (Meiji 4), the administrative 
office (``kochou-yakuba'') of Shiriuchi village was established.  It 
was a continuation of village chief system from the Edo era.
	In 1881 (Meiji 14), the administrative office (``kochou-
yakuba'') of Shiriuchi village was re-established.  It covered 
Kotaniishi [\u5C0F\u8C37\u77F3] village.  [by ``Shin-Shiriuchi-choushi 
[new Shiriuchi Town history]'' published in 2015.]
	In 1906 (Meiji 39), Shiriuchi Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established by the merger of Shiriuchi village and Kotaniishi 
village.  In 1967 (Shouwa 42), Shiriuchi Town was established.
	[See the note of Matsumae Town for 2nd-class municipality.] 

TOWN HALL, TRAFFIC

 	The town hall of Shiriuchi is located near the mouth of the 
Shiriuchi River.  National Route 228 (Fukuyama-kaidou) runs.  The name 
``Fukuyama'' means the castle town of the Matsumae Domain.
 	The national route runs along the coast, goes inland near the 
town hall, and leads to Fukushima Town.  Previously, there was 
Oshima-shiriuchi Station on the Matsumae Line.
	(The Matsumae Line was operated by Japanese National Railways 
[``Kokutetsu''[ until 1987.  The rialroad was abolished in 1988 after 
the management was transferred to JR Hokkaidou.)
	There was Shiriuchi Station on the Kaikyou Line. It became a 
roadside station (Michi-no-eki).  Visitors can watch the Shinkansen 
coming out of the undersea tunnel.  #3

INDUSTRY

Distinctive industries in Shiriuchi are agriculture, fishery, forestry, 
and power generation.  STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 422 
hectares in 2015, soybeans 124, buckwheat 85, pasture 54, fodder 18, 
	(continued) --> spinach 14, wheat 3, potatoes 2, orchards 1, 
flowers 1, and other vegetables 95+X (including Nira [Chinese chive or 
gynmigit]); dairy cows 112 head in 2015.  STATISTICS OF FISHERIES = s
quid (flying squid 296 tons in 2017, other squid 20), salmon 66, 
	(continued) --> sea urchins 30, seaweed 13 (Konbu kelp), 
shellfish 11 (oysters), olive flounder 10, right-eye flounder 6 
(marbled flounder), octopus 5, anchovy 4, yellowtail 4, sharks 1, 
mackerel 1, herring 0, other fish 20, and other marine animals 3.
 	According to a study on agricultural regionalization, the town 
was classified as a ``small-scale, single-crop, paddy rice'' area.  Due 
to the decrease in rice consumption, paddy rice decreased and Nira 
(Chinese chive) increased.
	Today, Shiriuchi is the largest producer of Nira in Hokkaidou. 
Nira is cultivated in greenhouses and harvested from January to 
October.  Nira is the vegetable included in Gyouza dumplings.  #4  #5 
 
NOTE
 
#1  In the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain traded hawks and falcons.  (In 
Japanese language, hawk is ``taka'' and falcon is ``hayabusa.'')  There 
were many bird-catching places in Ezo (now Hokkaidou).  Shiriuchi was 
one of the best places.
	Hawk catchers (``taka-machi'') searched for hawk (and falcon) 
nests in summer.  They wintered in Ezo, caught hawk chicks in spring, 
and gave them to the Matsumae Domain.  The birds were shipped to Edo 
(now Tokyo).  The Tokugawa Shogunate trained them for falcony.  
Feathers of hawks were also traded for making arrow fletchings.
	Ainu people also caught hawks (and falcons).  They sold hawks 
to Japanese people.  Ainu hunters hid in huts nearby streams, using 
salmon as lure.  When hawks appeared, Ainu hunters caught them by 
hooking their legs.
	Ainu people also kept hawks to take feathers.  They also kept 
young bears.  To them, bears were gods.
	[See Noboribetsu City in Iburi sub-prefecture for bear ranch.]

#2  Shiriuchi Town has a long history of Japanese immigration.  
Wakimoto Shrine in Kitsune-goshi district was established in 1239.  
Raikou Shrine in the center of the town was established in 1244. 
Shiriuchi Hot Spring was discovered by gold miners in 1247.  These are 
very old shrines and a hot spring in Hokkaidou. 
	Shrines in the Tama Hills of Tokyo, where I live now, are 
much newer than those in Shiriuchi Town.  In the past, priests at 
shrines were like village chiefs, because they could write documents.
	Fort Wakimoto-date was located in Wakimoto district in 
Shiriuchi Town.  It was located near Cape Kitsune-goshi.  The fort was 
destroyed by the Ainu forces during Koshamain's War.
	[See Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for Koshamain's 
War.] 
	* * * 
	Cape Kitsune-goshi is located to the south of Wakimoto 
district.  Wakimoto is one of the oldest villages in Hokkaidou.  The 
name ``Kitsune-goshi'' is Japanese, which means ``fox, pass.''
	To the west of Cape Kitsune-goshi is Kotaniishi district.  To 
the west of Kotaniishi district is Cape Yagoshi.  The name ``Ya-goshi'' 
is Japanese, which means ``arrow, pass.''
	 Cape Yagoshi is a sea cliff whose altitude is 121 meters.  The 
road along the sea is a dead end.  

#3  At the observatory of Shiriuchi Roadside Station, there is a time 
table for the Shinkansen trains (bullet trains) entering and leaving 
the undersea Seikan Tunnel.
	Part of the former Shiriuchi Station on the Kaikyou Line became 
Yu-no-sato Signal Station.  Yu-no-sato Signal Station is the end of the 
undersea tunnel.  There was another Yu-no-sato Station on the former 
Matsumae Line.
	The name ``Yu-no-sato'' is Japanese, which means ``village of 
hot spring.'' Yu-no-sato is a district along the Shiriuchi River.  
There is Shiriuchi Hot Spring.
	[See Kikonai Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the Kaikyou 
Line.]
 
#4  Oysters are cultivated in the open sea in Shiriuchi.  It is a 
unique method.  Generally, oysters are cultivated along the coast. 
Shiriuch Oysters are advertised at tasting events in Susukino.  
(Susukino is the largest entertainment district in Hokkaidou.  It is 
located in Chuuou Ward, Sapporo City.)
	As for power generation, Shiriuchi Power Plant is located in 
Motomachi district.  Hokkaidou Electric Power Company runs it. The 
power station uses heavy oil and Orimulsion. Orimulsion is a new fossil 
fuel.
	In summer, the power plant sells electricity to Tokyo Electric 
Power Company.  Tokyo metropolitan areas consume a huge amount of 
electricity in summer.  The climate is hot and humid.
	The electricity is transmitted through the undersea Seikan 
Tunnel.  The power cables are direct current (``choku-ryuu'').  Direct 
current is suitable for high voltage and long-distance transmission. 
Generally, electricity is transmitted as alternating current 
(``kouku-ryuu'').
 
#5  As for sightseeing, Shiriuchi is the hometown of Saburou Kitajima, 
a famous Enka singer.  Enka is a traditional style Japanese music. 
There is Saburou Kitajima Memorial Museum in Hakodate City.
	When I guided an excursion in Tokyo, we happened to pass by the 
Enka singer's residence.  It was near the former site of another Enka 
singer's residence.  Students did not know them.  Time has passed.
 	This is one of Kitajima's famous songs;
``Yosaku-wa-ki-wo-kiru, hey hey hoo
  (Yosaku cuts trees, hey hey hoo).''
	When I hear this song, I imagine a forestry office (``eirin-
sho'') in Hokkaidou.  Forests are vast in the north island.

LOCATION

Kikonai [ki-ko-na-i] [\u6728\u53E4\u5185] is a town in Oshima sub-
prefecture, south Hokkaidou (``dou-nan'').  Kikonai is located in the 
southwest of the Oshima Peninsula.  This part of the Oshima peninsula 
is called the Matsumae Peninsula.  The area of Kikonai faces the 
Tsugaru Strait.  Forests cover 88 percent of the area.

NAME

The name ``Kikonai'' is derived from ``rir-o-nay'' in Ainu language.  
It means ``tide, enter, stream.''  It signified the Kikonai River.  
Saltwater entered the estuary at high tide.

HISTORY

In the 15th century, Nakano-date (Fort Nakano) existed.  That was one 
of 12 forts in Ezo (old Hokkaidou).
	[See Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the former 
12 forts.]
	In the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain ruled this area.  The name 
``Kikonai'' appears on the map of Ezo, which was drawn by the Matsumae 
Domain in 1624.
	After the Meiji period, in 1879 (Meiji 12), the administrative 
office (``kochou-yakuba'') of Kikonai village was established.  In 1902 
(Meiji 35), Kikonai Village (2nd-class municipality) was established by 
the merger of four villages; Kikonai, Kamatani [\u91DC\u8C37], 
Izumisawa [\u6CC9\u6CA2], and Sakkari [\u672D\u82C5].
	In 1919 (Taishou 8), Kikonai Village (1st-class municipality) 
was established.  In 1942 (Shouwa 17), Kikonai Town was established.  
#1  #2
	[See the note of Matsumae Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class 
municipalities.]

TOWN HALL, TRAFFIC

The town hall of Kikonai is located near the mouth of the Kikonai 
River.  National Route 228 (Fukuyama-kaidou) runs.  Kikonai is a 
station on the Hokkaidou Shinkansen.  Kikonai is also the terminal of 
the Dou-nan Isaribi Railway.  #3
	The name ``Isaribi'' is Japanese.  It means ``fishing lamp.''
Lamps for squid fishing float on the sea.  The fishing season for squid 
is from June to December.
	[See Hakodate City and Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture 
for squid fishing.]
 	In the past, the Esashi Line and the Matsumae Line ran.  
Kikonai was a transportation hub in the Matsumae Peninsula.  
Governmental offices were located in the center of the town such as a 
summary court, a forestry office (``eirin-sho''), and a railway yard by 
Japanese National Railways (``Koku-tetsu'').  #4

INDUSTRY, CULTURE

Distinctive industries in Kikonai are fishery, agriculture, animal 
husbandry (including Hakodate Wagyuu Beef), and forestry (including 
Dou-nan Ceder).  STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 291 hectares in 
2015, pasture 188, fodder 26, orchards 5, potatoes 4, spinach 2, 
	(continued) --> soybeans 1, radishes 1, and yams 1; dairy cows

	The country sign (gateway sign) of Kikonai signifies Kanchuu-
misogui festival.  The name ``Kanchuu-misogui'' means ``winter, 
purification'' in Japanese.  The festival has been held since 1831.  
	During the festival, practitioners enter the sea in January.  
The temperature of the sea in winter is warmer than lakes and rivers, 
however, the location is Hokkaidou island.
 
NOTE
 
#1  During the Boshin War, the battle of Kikonai happened in 1869 
(Meiji 2).  The Meiji government forces advanced from Esashi to 
Hakodate.  The former Tokugawa Shogunate forces counter-attacked. 
	One of the routes taken by the Meiji government forces was the 
Kikonai mountain trail (Kikonai-sandou).  The commander of the former 
Tokugawa Shogunate was Keisuke Ootori.
	After being defeated in the Boshin War, Keisuke Ootori was 
imprisoned.  He was released and served for the Meiji government.  He 
became Japan's ambassador to Korea.
	During the Edo era, Keisuke Ootori studied Western medicine, 
learned English from John Manjirou, imported Western-style military 
tactics.  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Ctori_Keisuke)
	[See Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the Boshin 
War.]

#2  In 1871 (Meiji 4), Kanrin-maru (a ship) sank at Cape Saraki in 
Kikonai.  The anchor of the ship is displayed in Kikonai Town's museum. 
Along National Route 228, there is a monument to the ship that reads 
``End-of-Kanrin-mauru.''
	Kanrin-maru was a battleship that the Tokugawa Shogunate 
purchased from the Netherlands.  It was the first Japanese ship that 
crossed the Pacific Ocean.  In 1860, to complete the conclusion of the 
Japan-US Treaty of Amity and Commerce, Kanrin-maru departed from the 
Port of Shinagawa on January 13th.
	Kanrin-maru arrived in the Port of San Francisco on February 
26th.  The captain was Kaishuu Katsu and the interpreter was Manjirou 
John.  On the outbound voyage, bad weather caused Japanese crew to be 
sea-sick.  Americans took over piloting.
	In 1867, the steam of Kanrin-maru was removed.  It became a 
cargo ship.  After the Meiji period, the new Meiji government owned the 
ship.  It sank during a heavy storm in September 1871, off the coast of 
Kikonai.
	At the time, the ship was carring 401 immigrants from Shiroishi 
Castle in the Sendai Domain to Hokkaidou.  No one died in the the 
shipwreck.
  
#3  Hokkaidou Shinkansen opened in 2016.  It is operated by JR 
Hokkaidou.  In the same year, the Esashi Line changed to the Dou-nan 
Isaribi Railway.  The operation was transferred from JR Hokkaidou to 
South Hokkaidou Railway Company (Dou-nan-isaribi-tetsudou). 
	The Esashi Line ran along the Tsugaru Strait.  It connected Go-
ryou-kaku Station in Hakodate City and Kikonai Station.  In the past, 
the Esashi Line entered mountains from Kikonai Town and leached to 
Esashi Town on the sea of Japan side.
	In 2012, Kikonai High School was closed.  In 2014, a section 
between Kikonai Station and Esashi Station on the Esashi Line closed. 
High school students are the main users of local railways.  Part of the 
abolished Esashi Line was converted to a trolley line for sightseeing.
	Kikonai Station on Hokkaidou Shinkansen is also the terminal of 
the Kaikyou Line.  The word ``kaikyou'' means ``strait'' in Japanese.  
The Kakyou Line runs through the undersea Seikan Tunnel.  After the 
opening of the Hokkaidou Shinkansen, only freight trains and special 
trains for group tours use the Kaikyou Line.
	The Hokkaidou Shinkansen uses the same undersea tunnel, 
however, the Shinkansen is not categorized as the Kaikyou line.  The 
track gauge (distance between two rails) is different between the 
Shinkansen and conventional railways including the Kaikyou Line.
	The Seikan Tunnel was made as a dual-gauge (three rails) and 
double-truck railway.  It means that there are six rails in the tunnel. 
	The Shinkansen (bullet train) is standard gauge (1,435 
millimeters).  Conventional railways are narrow gauge (1,067 
millimeters).  Narrow gauge is cheaper to build.
	[See Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the undersea 
tunnel.]
	The former Matsumae Line connected Kikonai Station and Matsumae 
Station.  The railway was abolished in 1988.  It was two years after 
the privatization of JNR (Japanese National Railways, ``Kokutetsu''). 
In the past, there were JNR-branded ashtrays in all passenger cars. 
They were made of thick steel and had a nice sound.
	There were many railways and their branch routes in Hokkaidou.  
In the past, many politicians promised many railways.

#4  Kikonai was a transportation hub in the Matsumae Peninsula. 
Woodworking factories were located near Kikonai Station.
	In the past, even television sets were made from wooden boards. 
Today, in Japanese offices, all desks and chairs are made of steel.
(My office is like a used book store whose space is occupied by steel 
shelves.)
	When I had a zoom meeting with a professor in Vietnam, I found 
a wooden desk and wooden door in the office.  When I visited a 
professor in Sao Paulo, Brazil, I also found a wooden desk, wooden 
chairs, and a wooden book shelf in the office.  I liked them.  

#5  As for dairy farming in Kikonai, in 1897 (Meiji 30), a milk 
collection facility was built.  Horse-drawn carriage transported raw 
milk to Toubetsu Trappist Monastery.  In 1919 (Taishou 8), condensed 
milk butter (``ren-nyuu'' butter) was produced in Kikonai.
	[See Hokuto City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the monastery.

south Hokkaidou (``dou-nan'').  The area faces Hakodate Bay and the 
Tsugaru Strait.  The Moheji River, the Oono River, and the Kunebetsu 
River flow.

NAME

The name ``Hokuto'' is Japanese.  It means the Big Dipper that shines 
in the northern sky.  It was named by public offering when Kamiiso 
[\u4E0A\u78EF] Town and Oono [\u5927\u91CE] Town were merged in 2006.  
#1

HISTORY

In the mid 15th century, Mobetsu-date [da-te] (a fort) was built near 
the mouth of the Moheji River.  It was one of the former 12 forts built 
by the Andou clan.  During the Edo era, the area was ruled by the 
Matsumae Domain. 
	[See Kaminokuni Town in Esashi sub-prefecture for the former 12 
forts built in south Hokkaidou.]
	After the Meiji period, in 1880 (Meiji 13), an administrative 
office (``kochou-yakuba'') was established for Oono and other five 
villages.  An administrative office was established for Kamiiso 
and four villages.
	In 1885 (Meiji 18), an administrative office was established 
for Moheji [\u8302\u8FBA\u5730] and another village (Ishibetsu 
[\u77F3\u5225]).  In 1900 (Meiji 33), Kamiiso Village (1st-class 
municipality) and Oono Village (1st-class municipality) were 
established.  
	In 1906 (Meiji 39), Mobetsu [\u8302\u5225] Village (2nd-class 
municipality) was established by the merger of Moheji and Ishibetsu 
villages.  In 1918 (Taishou 7), Kamiiso Town was established.  In 1955 
(Shouwa 30), Kamiiso Town merged Mobetsu Village.  In 1957 (Shouwa 32), 
Oono Town was established.
	[See the note of Matsumae Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class 
municipalities.]

CITY HALL, TRAFFIC, POPULATION

The city hall of Hokuto is located near the mouth of the Oono River.  
It used to be the town hall of Kamiiso Town.  National Route 228 
(Fukuyama-kaidou) and the Dou-nan Isaribi Railway run along Hakodate 
Bay.  #2
	[See Kikonai Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the Dou-nan 
Isaribi Railway.  See Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 
Fukuyama-kaidou.]
 	The population of Hokuto City increased.  In the southern part 
of the municipality, residential, commercial, and manufacturing areas 
are continued from the center of Hakodate City. 
	In the northern part, National Route 227 (Oono-kokudou) runs 
through the Oono Plain.  The national highway crosses the ridge and 
leads to Esashi Town.  Shin-hakodate-hokuto Station on the Hokkaidou 
Shinkansen is located near the border with Nanae Town.  It used to be 
Oshima-oono Station on the Hakodate Main Line.   

INDUSTRY

Distinctive industries in Hokuto are manufacturing, agriculture, and 
fishery.  STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 1,198 hectares in 
2015, fodder 659, beans (soybeans 239, adzuki beans 9, other beans 5),

	On the satellite image, a straight line stretches from Hokuto 
City to Hakodate Bay.  The line is a jetty of Taiheiyou Cement's 
Kamiiso Factory.  The limestone deposit for the cement industry was 
discovered in 1872 by Benjamin Smith Lyman.  Lyman was an American 
mining scholar invited by the Meiji government.  #3
	Paddy rice cultivation started in Oono district in the late 
17th century.  It was the first rice cultivation in Hokkaidou.  #4
	As for sightseeing, the building printed on the country sign 
(gateway sign) is Toubetsu Trappist Monastery.  The monastery is 
located to the west, near the border with Kikonai Town.  The old red-
brick buildings and tree-lined avenues are famous.  #5

NOTE 

#1  The former Kamiiso Town was located along Hakodate Bay.  The name 
``Kamiiso'' was derived from Kamiiso county, which was established in 
1869 (Meiji 2).  The county's name was suggestion by Takeshirou 
Matsuura, who explored Ezo (now Hokkaidou) in the Edo era.
	The name ``Kami-iso'' is Japanese.  It means ``upper, coast.'' 
The word ``upper'' refers to the west, where the castle of the 
Matsumae Domain was located.
	In the Edo era, the area of the former Kamiiso Town was 
Arukawa village and Hekerechi village.  The names were documented in 
Matsumae Island Village Record (Matsumae-tou-gou-chou) published in 
1700.  Today, in Hokuto City, there are Arikawa-dai-jinguu Shrine and 
the Hekirichi River.
	[See Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for Matsumae 
Island Village Record.]
	The former Oono Town was located inland.  The name ``Oo-no'' is 
Japanese, which means ``large, plain.''   The name ``Oono'' is old, 
which was documented in Matsjmae Island Village Record (Matsumae-tou-
gou-chou) published in 1700.
	* * *
	Takeshirou Matsuura may have derived the name ``Kamiiso'' from 
Kamiiso-kaidou (Kamiiso trail) in Tsugaru (now Aomori Prefecture).
	Kamiiso-kaidou was called Matsumae-kaidou.  It connected Abura-
kawa (now part of Aomori City) and Min-maya (now part of Sotoga-hama 
Town, Aomori Prefecture).  Min-maya was a port for heading to Matsumae.
	Takeshirou Matsuura also suggested Hiyama county and Tsugaru 
county in Hokkaidou.  Those names (Kamiiso, Hiyama, and Tsugaru) are 
related to the places in the Touhoku Region that have historical 
connections to Hokkaidou.
	The trail that connects Matsumae and Hakodate was called 
Fukuyama-kaidou (Fukuyama trail).  Fukuyama was the castle town of the 
Matsumae Domain.
	[See Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for Fukuyama-
kaidou.]
 
#2  I traveled on National Route 228 (Fukuyama-kaidou) on a bus 
excursion.  I saw many concrete wave-breaking blocks along the coast 
of Hokuto.  Hokuto is one of the largest cement producing 
municipalities in the country.
	Wave-breaking blocks are known as Tetrapods.  The name was the 
patent of Neyrpic, a French company.  I heard this story from Professor 
Tsuguo Sunamura at University of Tsukuba in 1995 (HTTP://2242.MOOO.COM/
POSI/95IZU/1452.JPG INDEX.HTM); 
 	``When executives of Neyrpic visited Japan, they found many 
fake Tetrapods along the coast.  Then, Nippon Tetrapod, a branch of 
Neyrpic, was established in 1961.
	The fake Tetrapods in Japan had metal hooks.  They were easy to 
install, however, they were less durable.  The metal hook corrodes.''

#3  As for cement industry in Hokuto City, Taiheiyou Cement Kamiiso 
Factory extracts limestone at Garou Mine.  The cement is transported to 
cargo ships via a long jetty.  The length is two kilometers.  The jetty
makes a long line on the map.
 	In 1884 (Meiji 17), a cement factory was established.  In 1890 
(Meiji 23), Hokkaidou Cement was established.  In 1915 (Taishou 4), 
Asano Cement acquired Hokkaidou Cement.
	After World War II, Asano zaibatsu was dismantled. 
(``Zaibatsu'' was a large conglomerate.)  Asano Cement changed its name 
to Nihon Cement.  In 1988 (Shouwa 63), Taiheiyou Cement was established 
by the merger of Nihon Cement and Chichibu Onoda Cement.  The product 
name ``Asano Cement'' was used until 1998. 
	Concrete is made from cement.  Cement is made from limestone, 
gravel, and water.  Limestone is self-sufficient in the small country.
Cities are like concrete jungles.  Limestone mountains are like 
skeletons.
	* * *
	Today, almost all electric poles are made of concrete. The 
oldest concrete electric pole is still used in Hakodate City.  It was 
installed in 1923 (Taishou 12) to prevent it from burning by fire.  (I 
like old wooden electric poles, although tourist destinations remove 
electricity poles nowadays.)

#4  The former Oono Town is the birth place of paddy rice cultivation 
in Hokkaidou.  It started in the Edo era.  There is a stone monument 
that commemorates the first paddy rice.  The inscription reads; 
	``In 1692, a farmer Sakuemon opened a paddy filed of 450 tsubo 
(0.15 hectares) using natural water and gained rice of 10-hyou.'' (One 
``hyou'' of rice is 60 kg.)
 	That record was excellent at the time. Today, a good paddy 
field that has a yield of 600 kg per 0.1 hectares.  Such paddy is 
called ``jippyo-dori (10-hyou gaining paddy).''
	According to oral tradition, paddy rice cultivation in the 
former Oono Town dates back to the Kanbun period (1661-1672) and 1685.
[By Yoshiaki Ishizuka & Tatsuzou Hoshino eds. 1994.  ``Hokkaidou-no-
inasaku [Rice cultivation of Hokkaidou].''  Hokunoukai.]
	Kametarou Ootomo was an engineer in the Edo era.  He instructed 
agriculture in Oono village (now Oono district in Hokuto City).  In 
1866, at the end of the Edo era, he moved to Sapporo with villagers 
and started developing the area.
	 Kametarou Ootomo constructed the Ootomo Canal.  It is now the 
Sousei River, which flows through the center of Sapporo City.  
Kametarou Ootomo (1834-1897) was a disciple of Sontoku Ninomiya (1787-
1856).
	Kyuuzou Nakayama was the owner of a post station (``eki-tei'') 
in what is now Kita-hirosima City.  He was known as the father of cold-
climate paddy rice cultivation.  In the Meiji period, he obtained rice 
seeds in Oono village, and succeeded in paddy rice cultivation in the 
Ishikari Plain.
	[See Hokuryuu Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture and Toyokoro Town 
in Tokachi sub-prefecture for Sontoku Ninomiya's thoughts.  See Kita-
hiroshima City in Ishikari sub-prefecture for rice cultivation under a 
cold climate.]

#5  Toubetsu Trappist Monastery sells butter, ice cream, and cookies. 
The monastery was established in 1896 (Meiji 29).  The monks started 
dairy farming.  Dairy farming spread to farmers in neighboring Kikonai 
village in the Meiji period.
	A monastery is a place where monks live together.  It is 
Catholic.  It is also Catholic to have statues of Mary and saints, 
alghough they do not pray to them.  Praying to idols is called 
idolatry.
	In the past, ordinary people could not read, therefore, 
churches made statues.  (Today, university teachers use PowerPoint too 
much.  The situation is like idolatry.  Students need a bible.)

LOCATION

Hakodate [ha-ko-da-te] [\u51FD\u9928] is a city in Oshima sub-
prefecture, south Hokkaidou (``dou-nan'').  The area faces Hakodate 
Bay, Tsugaru Strait, and the Pacific Ocean.  It occupies the southeast 
of the Oshima Peninsula.  This part of the Oshima Peninsula is called 
the Kameda Peninsula. 
	Mt. Hakodate stands from Hakodate Bay.  The height is 334 
meters.  (Tokyo Tower is 333 meters.)  The area of Hakodate was newly 
formed in 2004 by the merger of Hakodate City, Toi Town, Minami-kayabe 
Town, Esan Town, and Todohokke Village.  #1  #2  #3 

NAME

The name ``Hako-date'' means ``box, fort'' in Japanese.  It referred to 
the box-like shape of a fort.  The fort was Usukeshi-date, which was 
run by the Kouno clan after 1454.  The Kouno clan was one of the 
vassals of the Andou clan, who built 12 forts in what is now south 
Hokkaidou.

HISTORY

Koshamain's War occurred in 1457.  Koshamain was a chief of Ainu 
people.  During the war, Usukeshi-date, so-called Hako-date, was 
destroyed by the Ainu forces.
	[See Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the Andou 
clan and Koshamain's War.]
	In the Edo era, the Port of Hakodate was managed by the 
Matsumae Domain and later by the Tokugawa Shogunate.  The port opened 
for American ships in 1854 under the Convention of Kanagawa (Japan-US 
Treaty of Peace and Amity).  #4
 	In the beginning of the Meiji period, Hakodate was the battle 
ground of the Boshin War (1868-1869).  In 1869 (Meiji 2), the Hokkaidou 
Development Commission was established.  In 1871, the head office 
of the Hokkaidou Development Commission moved to Sapporo.  #5
	In 1879 (Meiji 12), Hakodate ward (Hakodate-ku [\u533A]) was 
established.  This ``ward'' was an administrative district, not a 
municipality.  In 1899 (Meiji 32), Hakodate Ward was established.  
This ``Ward'' was a municipality (local government).
	In 1922 (Taishou 11), Hakodate City was established.  In 1939 
(Shouwa 14), Hakodate City merged Yunokawa [\u6E6F\u5DDD] Town (1st-
class municipality).  Yunokawa Town was located around Yunokawa Hot 
Spring.
	[See Kushiro Town in Kushiro sub-prefecture for Wards (``ku'') 
in Hokkaidou.  See the note of Matsumae Town for 1st-class 
municipality.]
	In 1966 (Shouwa 41), Hakodate City merged Zenigame-zawa [\u92AD
\u4E80\u6CA2] Village (the former 1st-class municipality).  Zenigame-
zawa was located around Hakodate Airport.  In 1973 (Shouwa 48), 
Hakodate City merged Kameda [\u4E80\u7530] City.  #6

CITY HALL, TRAFFIC, PULATION
  
The city hall of Hakodate and the Port of Hakodate are located at the 
foot of Mt. Hakodate.  National Route 5 and the Hakodate Main Line 
start from the port.
	Hakodate was the gateway to Japan in the late 19th century, 
during the Edo era.  Hakodate was the gateway to Hokkaidou from the 
late 19th century to the late 20th century.
	The Seikan Train Ferry (Seikan-renraku-sen) connected Hakodate 
and Aomori.  The name ``Sei-kan'' is an abbreviation of Aomori and 
Hakodate in Kanji characters.  #7
	The population peaked in 1980 at 345,165 (including 
municipalities of Hakodate, Toi, Esan, Minami-kayabe, and Todohokke). 
The population decreased. The reasons are (1) the end of pelagic 
fishing (deep-sea fishing), (2) opening of the Seikan Tunnel, (3) an 
increase in air travelers, and (4) motorization and suburbanization.  
#8

INDUSTRY

Distinctive industries in Hakodate are sightseeing, fishery, fish 
processing, trade, and ship-building.  STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = 
potatoes 393 hectares in 2015, pasture 260, paddy rice 73, cabbage 54,

	As for sightseeing, famous tourist sites are Go-ryou-kaku 
Castle, Mt. Hakodate, night view from Mt. Hakodate, old Western-style 
buildings, old churches in Motomachi district, brick warehouses on an 
old wharf, Ekini market, Yunokawa Hot Spring, and landscape of the 
slopes (``saka-michi'') filmed in movies and TV dramas.  #10
	Go-ryou-kaku Castle was built inland to avoid artillery from 
foreign ships.  In 1854, the Tokugawa Shogunate singed the Japan-US 
Treaty of Peace and Amity.  From 1857 to 1866, they constructed Go-ryou
-kaku.  Go-ryou-kaku became the last castle of the Tokugawa Shogunate 
forces.  It fell in the Boshin War.
	Today, tourists enjoy climbing up an observation tower in 
front of the castle.  The height of the tower is 100 meters.  Visitors 
can look down on the pentagonal shape of the castle.  The name ``Go-
ryou-kaku'' is Japanese.  It means ``five, point, fort.''  Cannons 
could be placed at the points. 
	In Hakodate, Western-style buildings that were built in the 
Meiji period has been preserved, for example, Hokkaidou Government 
Hakodate Branch Office and Hakodate Ward Public Hall. They were 
constructed after the great fires in the Meiji period.  #11
	At Ekini market, tourists can enjoy squid fishing.  The squid 
they catch is eaten on the spot.  Ekini market used to be a morning 
fair in front of Hakodate Station.  #12

NOTE
  
#1  Mt. Hakodate is also called Ga-gyuu-san in Japanese.  It means 
``lying-cow mountain.''  The shape of the mountain resembles a lying 
cow.
	In the Meiji period, the top of Mt. Hakodate was removed by 14 
meters, because guns were placed.  Mt. Hakodate was a military base 
from the Meiji period to the Shouwa period (before Wold War II).
	Some people say that the nature of Mt. Hakodate remains, 
because only military personnel entered the mountain.  However, after 
the fort called Hako-date was built in the 15th century, people cut 
down native trees.  In the past, trees were used not only as building 
materials but also as energy (firewood).
	Today, cedar trees can be seen along the tourist road of Mt. 
Hakodate.  Buses go on the road and a ropeway runs above it.  The ceder 
trees have been cultivated since the Edo era (about 200 years ago).
	The night view from Mt. Hakodate is counted as one of the World 
Top Three Night Views, along with Hong Kong and Naples.  Sometimes, 
Nagasaki is counted as the top three instead of Hakodate.  Nagasaki is 
also a port city.
	World Top Three rankings were counted by Japanese people.  In 
the past, they traveled all over the world by ship.  Japan is a 
maritime country.
	[See Kushiro City in Kushiro sub-prefecture for the World Top 
Three Sunset.]
	* * *
	Mt. Hakodate is a mountain and a land-tied island.  The city 
hall of Hakodate is located on a sandbar.  A sandbar linking a land-
tied island is called ``tombolo'' in geography.  In the Meiji period, 
the central business district (CBD) of Hakodate was located on tombolo.
	The CBD moved inland.  It was located in front of Hakodate 
Station in the Shouwa period.  Currently, it is located in front of Go-
ryou-kaku Castle.  When I visited Hakodate in 2013, I found many ``For 
Rent'' signs on the second floor near Hakodate Station.
 
#2  The Tsugaru Strait has two necks.  A neck is a narrow part of the 
sea.  The east neck is located between the Kameda Peninsula in Hakodate 
City and the Shimokita Peninsula in Aomori Prefecture.
	The west neck is located between the Matsumae Peninsula in 
Matsumae Town and the Tsugaru Peninsula in Aomori Prefecture.  The 
Seikan Tunnel was constructed under the west neck.
	[See Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the Tsugaru 
Strait.  See Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the Seikan 
undersea tunnel.]
  
#3  The former Toi [\u6238\u4E95] Town (now Hakodate City) was located 
in the southern end of the Kameda Peninsula.  The name ``Toi'' comes 
from ``toi-o-i'' in Ainu language.  It means ``edible soil, exist, 
place.''  It signified that there was diatomite [dai'-ato-maito] 
(``keisoudo'' in Japanese).  (Diatomite is a fossil of diatom [keisou]. 
It is edible.)
	In the Edo era, Toi was a village.  The name was documented in 
Matsumae Island Village Record (Matsumae-tou-gou-chou [\u677E\u524D
\u5CF6\u90F7\u5E33]), which was published in the Tenpou period (1831-
1845) in the Edo era.
	(Matsumae Island Village Record published in 1834 is available 
here --> http://www.digital.archives.go.jp/gallery/0000000323  Matsumae 
Island Village Record published in 1700 is available here --> http://
ja.wikisource.org/wiki/%E6%9D%BE%E5%89%8D%E5%B3%B6%E9%83%B7%E5%B8%B3) 
	After the Meiji period, in 1879 (Meiji 12), the administrative 
office (``kochou-yakuba'') of Toi village was established.  In 1902 
(Meiji 35), Toi Village (2nd-class municipality) was established.  In 
1919 (Taishou 8), Toi Village (1st-class municipality) was established. 
In 1968 (Shouwa 43), Toi Town was established.
	[See the note of Matsumae Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class 
municipalities.]
	The other side of Toi, across the Tsugaru Strait, is Ooma Town 
in Aomori Prefecture.  Ooma is famous for Ooma's tuna.  The same tuna 
is caught in Toi.  Toi's tuna is cheaper than Ooma's tuna (I heard 
this in the 2010s.)  The taste of the tuna caught in the Tsugaru Strait 
is good.  The tuna eat flying squid.
	* * *
 	The former Minami-kayabe [\u5357\u8305\u90E8] Town (now 
Hakodate City) was located to the east of the Kameda Peninsula.  The 
name ``Minami-kayabe'' means ``south, kayabe.''
	[See Mori Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the name 
``Kayabe.'']
	In 1879 (Meiji 12), the administrative office (``kochou-
yakuba'') of Osatsube [\u5C3E\u672D\u90E8] village was established.  In 
1880 (Meiji 13), the administrative office of Usujiri [\u81FC\u5C3B] 
village was established.  Those villages had existed from the Edo era.
	In 1906 (Meiji 39), Osatsube Village (2nd-class municipality) 
and Usujiri Village (2nd-class municipality) were established.  In 1959 
(Shouwa 39), Minami-kayabe Town was established by the merger of 
Osatsube Village and Usujiri Village.
	In 1975, a hollow clay figurine was dug from a potato field in 
Minami-kayambe Town.  It is the only national treasure in Hokkaidou. 
Previously, Matsumae Castle (Fukuyama Castle) was counted as a national 
treasure.  The castle was destroyed by fire (not by war). 
	[See Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for Matsumae 
Castle.]
	* * *
	The former Esan [\u6075\u5C71] Town (now Hakodate City) was 
located in the eastern end of the Kameda Peninsula.  The area faces the 
Tsugaru Strait.
	The name ``Esan'' comes from ``e-san-i'' in Ainu language.  It 
means ``head, stick out, place.''  It signified Mt. Esan (618 meters). 
Mt. Esan is an active volcano.  The bare soil stands out from the 
Pacific Ocean.
	In the the Edo era, Shirikishinai [\u5C3B\u5CB8\u5185] village 
was established.  After the Meiji period, in 1872 (Meiji 5), the 
administrative office (``kochou-yakuba'') of Shirikishinai village was 
established.  It was a continuation of village chief system from the 
Edo era.
	In 1879 (Meiji 12), the administrative office of Shirikishinai 
village was re-established.  In 1906 (Meiji 39), Shirikishinai Village 
(2nd-class municipality) was established.  In 1964 (Shouwa 39), 
Shirikishinai Town was established.  In 1985 (Shouwa 60), the name was 
changed to Esan. It was named after Mt. Esan.
	* * *
	The former Todohokke [\u6934\u6CD5\u83EF] Village in Hakodate 
City was located in the eastern end of the Kameda Peninsula.  It was 
the smallest municipality in Hokkaidou (25 square kilometers, as same 
as Atsubetsu Ward in Sapporo).
	The name ``Todohokke'' comes from ``tu-pok-ke'' in Ainu 
language.  It means ``mountain foot, under, place.''  It signified the 
mountain foot of Mt. Esan.  The Kanji characters for ``Todohokke'' are 
very difficult to read. 
	In the Edo era, the area of Todohokke was included in Osatsube 
village.  After the Meiji period, in 1880 (Meiji 13), the 
administrative office of Todohokke village was established.  In 1919 
(Taishou 8), it became Todohokke Village (2nd-class municipality).

#4  The Port of Hakodate was a natural port.  Japanese people called it 
``tsuna-shirazu (rope, no need).''  They also called it Tomoe Port 
(spiral port) due to the spiral-like topography.
	The Japan-US Treaty of Peace and Amity (Nichi-bei-washin-
jouyaku) was concluded in 1854.  It was concluded between the Tokugawa 
Shogunate and the United States.  The Port of Hakodate and the Port of 
Shimoda were opened.  (Shimoda is located in the Izu Peninsula, 
Shizuoka Prefecture).
	(The name ``Japan'' is English.  In Japanese, it is called 
''Nihon.''  Therefore, the name ``the Sea of Japan'' is 100 percent 
English.) 
	* * *
	Japanese isolation policy was ended due to the effort 
(pressure) of Matthew Perry, who was the commander of the East India 
Squadron in the United States.
	On his black steamships (``kuro-fune''), Matthew Perry appeared 
in many ports in Japan after 1853.  The flagship was Susquehanna.  
Japanese people were surprised at the black ships, which moved by steam 
engine.  At the time, sail ships were moved by the wind.
	[See Takikawa City in Sorachi sub-prefecture for steamers.]
	In 1859, the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between Japan and the 
United States (Nichi-bei-syuukou-tsuushou-jouyaku) was concluded.  It 
was concluded between the Tokugawa Shogunate and the United States.  
	Then, along with Hakodate, the ports of Kanagawa (Yokohama), 
Nagasaki, Hyougo (Koube), and Niigata were opened.  The Port of Shimoda 
was closed instead of Kanagawa.
	Foreign settlements were built near the ports.  Cities of Edo 
(now the center of Tokyo) and Oosaka were opened for foreign visitors.  
  
#5  The Boshin War was a civil war between the new Meiji government 
forces and the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces.  The final phase of 
the war is called the Hakodate War.  The former Tokugawa Shogunate 
forces aimed to establish the Republic of Ezo.  (Ezo is what is now 
Hokkaidou).
	[See Kikonai Town, Matsumae Town, Mori Town in Oshima sub-
prefecture, Assabu Town, Esashi Town, and Otobe Town in Hiyama sub-
prefecture for the Boshin War.]
	Takeaki Enomoto (1836-1908) was the commander of the former 
Tokugawa Shogunate forces.  He learned English from John Manjirou and 
studied in the Netherlands.  After the defeat in the Boshin War, 
Takeaki Enomoto was appointed by Kiyotaka Kuroda and worked for the 
Hokkaidou Development Commission. 
	Kiyotaka Kuroda (1840-1900) was a samurai in the Satsuma Domain 
(now Kagoshima Prefecture.)  He became an officer in the new Meiji 
government forces.  After the war, he became the undersecretary (vice 
miiister) of the Hokkaidou Development Commission.  He invited American 
advisors to Hokkaidou.
	Toshizou Hijikata (1835-1869) was an officer of the former 
Tokugawa Shogunate forces.  He was killed in the Hakodate War.  In the 
Edo era, he was the vice-commander of Shinsen-gumi.  Shinsen-gumi was 
the special forces of the Tokugawa Shogunate.
	* * *
  	Shinpachi Nagakura (1839-1915) was the strongest swordsman 
in Shinsen-gumi.  There is a small plaque to him near the main gate of 
Hokkaidou University.
	He was born and raised in the Edo branch of the Matsumae 
Domain.  (Edo was the center of today's Tokyo.  The Matsumae Domain 
ruled what is now Hokkaidou in the Edo era.)  He learned several 
swordsmanship schools in Edo.  He fled the Matsumae Domain.
	After Shinsen-gumi was abolished, he participated in the Boshin 
War, although he did not participated in the Hakodate War.  (The 
Hakodate War was the final phase of the Boshin War.)
	At the time, he was a member of the Tokugawa Shogunate forces. 
If he had participated in the Hakodate War, he would have to fight 
against the Matsumae Domain, which was his former monarch.
	In the Meiji period, Shinpachi Nagakura taught swordsmanship in 
Kabato Prison and in Agricultural Collage of Touhoku Imperial 
University (now Hokkaidou University).
 	Among the swordsmanship schools that Shinpachi Nagakura 
learned, he got the highest rank (``menkyo-kaiden'') in Shintou-munen-
ryuu.  Shintou-munen-ryuu features powerful sword strokes.
	[See Tsukigata Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for Kabato Prison 
and Shinpachi Nagakura.]
 
#6  As for the former Kameda City (now Hakodate City), the name ``Kame-
da'' is Japanese.  It means ``turtle, paddy field.''  It is a good-luck 
name.
	According to an old Chinese legend, turtles (``kame'') live 
10,000 years and cranes (``tsuru'') live 1,000 years.  There were 
paddy fields in Kameda, however, there were no freshwater turtles in 
Hokkaidou.
	[See Chitose City in Ishikari sub-prefecture for good-luck 
name.]
	In the early 17th century, the Matsumae Domain built a 
guardhouse (``bansho'') in Kameda.  It was moved to Hakodate in the 
18th century.  After the Meiji period, from 1879 (Meiji 12) to 1881 
(Meiji 14), seven administrative offices for 25 villages were 
established in Kameda county [\u4E80\u7530\u90E1]. 
	In 1902 (Meiji 23), Kameda Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established.  At the time, the villages of Kameda, Kamiyama, Kaji, 
Kikyou, and Ishikawa were merged.  In 1919 (Taishou 8), Kameda Village 
(1st-class municipality) was established.
	[See the note of Matsumae Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class 
municipalities.] 
	In 1962 (Shouwa 37), Kameda Town was established.  In 1971 
(Shouwa 46), Kameda City was established.  In 1973 (Shouwa 48), Kameda 
City was merged by Hakodate City.  Kameda City existed only for two 
years and one month.  (Fushimi City in Kyouto Prefecture existed only 
for one year and eleven months.)
	The former Kameda City is located west of Hakodate City.  The 
area includes Go-ryou-kaku Station and Kikyou Station on the Hakodate 
Main Line.  The address of Go-ryou-kaku Station is Kameda-honchou, 
which means ``Kameda main town'' in Japanese.

#7  The Seikan Train Ferry operated from 1908 (Meiji 41) to 1988 
(Shouwa 63).  In September 1954, the ferry Touya-maru was sunk in the 
Touya-maru Typhoon (Typhoon Marie).  The shipwreck killed 1,155 people. 
Then, plans for the Seikan undersea tunnel moved forward.
	[See Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the Seikan 
Tunnel.]
	There is a famous song called Tsugaru-kaikyou-fuyu-gueshiki 
(Tsugaru Strait Winter Scene).  The lyrics depict the people on the 
Sikan Train Ferry. The lyrics are like this; ``People returning north 
are quiet.  They only hear the sound of the sea.''
	* * *
	This was my sales pitch to invite master students, ``It 
is good to live in this north island for two years.  Cities in Honshuu 
island are too hot.''
	Travelers from Honshuu island would think that Hakodate and 
Sapporo are close, because they are in the same prefecture.  However, 
it takes 4 hours by express train, 4 hours by expressway, and 5.5 hours 
by bus.  The route goes around Uchiura Bay (Volcano Bay).

#8  The Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ, a 200 nautical mile zone) was 
activated in the 1980s.  (200 nautical mile is about 370 kilometers.) 
It ended North Ocean Fishing (deep-sea fishing, ``hokuyou-gyogyou'' in 
Japanese).
	In the past, the ports of Hakodate, Kushiro, and Nemuro were 
bases for North Ocean Fishing.  (Also, ports of Otaru, Rumoi, Wakkanai, 
Monbetsu, Abashiri, and Furubira were for North Ocean Fishing.)
	Groups of ships departed the ports to catch salmon near Russian 
and US Alaskan waters.  Hakodate was a base for mother-ship (``bosen'') 
type fishing.  Kushiro and Nemuro were bases for mother-port 
(``bokou'') type fishing.  The mother-ship equipped a factory to make 
canned salmon.
	Incidentally, there is ``mother'' in the word ``sea'' in 
French (``mer'' and ``mere [m\u00E8re]'') and in Japanese (``haha 
[\u6BCD]'' and ``umi [\u6D77]'').

#9  As for trade in Hakodate City, the main importing countries are 
Russia (coal, fish), China (fish), and South Korea (petroleum 
products).  The main exporting country is Panama (flag-of-convenience 
ships) (as of 2011, by Hakodate Customs).  Coal from Russia is used in 
the cement industry in Hokuto City.
	As for ship-building, Hakodate Dock manufactures bulk carriers, 
cement carriers, and fishing boats.  As for fishery, squid are caught 
near the coast from June to December.  During the fishing season, 
fishing lamps float on the sea.  It is a fantastic scene. (HTTP://
2242.MOOO.COM/POSI/98HOK/6052.JPG INDEX.HTM)

#10  Slopes are prominent in port cities, such as Hakodate, Nagasaki, 
San Francisco, and Rio de Janeiro.  Slopes in Hakodate are straight and 
lead to the sea.  The landscape is unique, because Japan is a 
mountainous country and roads curve along contours. 
	[See Yuni Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for straight roads.]
 
#11  The center of Hakodate suffered many fires.  Large fires occurred 
in 1879 (Meiji 12), 1899 (Meiji 32), 1907 (Meiji 40), 1934 (Shouwa 9), 
and 1945 (Shouwa 25, air raids).  There is a buffer zone near the city 
hall, where Tochi-no-ki (horse chestnut, marronnier) trees are planted.
	In Honshuu island, people say ``Mochi-no-ki trees prevent the 
spread of fire.''  Mochi-no-ki is bird-lime holly, a kind of forever-
green broad-leaved tree.  Bird-lime (``tori-mochi'') was extracted from
Mochi-no-ki trees.
	(When I was a child, my neighbors caught birds using bird-
lime.  Warbling white-eye [``mejiro''] is an expensive bird.  The 
bird sings in a beautiful sound.  Today, capturing wild birds is 
prohibited by law.) 
 
#12  I visited Hakodate on excursions in May 2013 and May 2017.  In 
both years, a Toshizou Hijikata Look-alike Contest was held at Go-ryou-
kaku Castle.  The winner of year 2017 was a woman.  Toshizou Hijikawa 
was the commander of the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces.  He dead in 
Hakodate at the end of the Boshin War. 
	As for the tram in Hakodate, a very old car runs with a ticket 
seller on board.  A red car runs too.  It is said that if you see a 
red tram, you will be happy.  (It must be a Coca-cola tram.)
	The last stop on the tram is Yunokawa Hot Spring.  It is Oku-
zashiki of Hakodate (so-called the inner parlor of Hakodate.)  Yunokawa 
Hot spring was opened by the Matsumae Domain in 1653.  In the hot 
spring, there was a nice and inexpensive hotel, which we stayed during 
excursions.  Today, it is difficult to stay at the hotel, because it 
became popular with foreign tourists.  It became expensive.
	* * *
	Local foods of Hakodate include Lucky Pierrot hamburgers, 
Madalena cookies from Trappistine Monastery, curry and rice, and the 
grilled-chicken lunch-box of Hasegawa Store.
	The restaurant Gotou-ken opened in the Meiji period.  It became 
popular for its curry and rice.  Nowadays, tourists like to eat curry 
and rice even in the morning at hotel buffets.
	As for Lucky Pierrot hamburgers; (1) It is popular than 
McDonald in Hakodate City, (2) It serves whale hamburgers, (3) It 
serves large hambergers, and (4) The shops are located near high 
schools.  The Food in port cities are hearty and delicious.
	[See Kushiro City in Kushiro sub-prefecture and Nemuro City in 
Nemuro sub-prefecture for the food in port cities.]
	* * *
	Curry was brought to Japan via the British Navy.  The original 
place of curry and rice is India.  It was the vassal state of the 
British Empire.  Naval cities in Japan such as Yokosuka and Sasebo 
appeal their curry and rice.
	Indian curry is like a soup.  Japanese curry is like a sauce, 
because naval crews ate it on traveling warships.  In Hokkaidou, curry 
was introduced not only in Hakodate but also in Sappro.  Curry and rice 
were served for American teachers and Japanese students at Sapporo 
Agricultural College.
	[See Hokkaidou University in Kita Ward, Sapporo City, Ishikari 
sub-prefecture, for curry and rice.]
	* * * 
 	Curry is basically a soup.  If a family serves curry and 
``miso'' (soybean paste) soup at the dinner, they retain an old custom. 
Curry and rice has been eaten by Japanese people for a long time.  In 
the past, farmers had many children.  Children were hungry and liked 
curry and rice.  Mothers cooked ``miso'' soup and curry so that all 
family members could eat curry.
	Brazilian people ate ``feijoada (soup of black beans and 
intestines)'' on Saturdays and Wednesdays.  Japan people ate curry 
and rice on Saturdays.  Those dishes provided stamina.  They were 
special dishes for laborers.  (I ate leftover curry on Sundays.)
	* * *
	There is a TV drama ``Shin-ya-shokudou (Midnight Dinner).'' One 
story features about butter rice and Hakodate City.  Butter rice is 
rice topped with butter and soy sauce.  
	Professor Tooru Ikeda at Faculty of Letters, Hokkaidou 
University, also recommended butter rice.  He was from Hokkaidou. 
Butter rice is popular in Hokkadou.  http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/

LOCATION

Nanae [na-na-e] [\u4E03\u98EF] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, 
south Hokkaidou (``dou-nan'').  Nanae is an inland town.  The Kunebetsu 
River flows south and empties into Hakodate Bay.
	Mt. Komagatake (1,131 meters, volcano) rises to the north. 
Lake Oonuma is located at the foot of Mt. Komagatake.  Lake Oonuma and 
Mt. Komgatake are designated as Oonuma Quasi National Park (Oonuma-
kokutei-kouen).

NAME

The name ``Nanae'' comes from ``naa-nay'' in Ainu language, which means 
``many, stream.''  Or, it comes from ``nam-nay'' in Ainu language, 
which means ``cold, stream.''  Both signified Nanae-hama beach along 
Hakodate Bay.
	Nanae-hama beach now belongs to Hokuto City.  Nanae has a long 
history of Japanese immigration, so the origin of the name is vague.
	Nanae Town belongs to Kameda county.  The name ``Kame-da'' 
means ``turtle, paddy.''  It is a good-luck name.
	[See Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the name 
``Kameda.''] 

HISTORY

Before the Edo era, Mishima Shrine was built in 1532.  It was around 
the time that a Japanese village was established.  When a Japanese 
village was established, a shrine was also established.  [By Nihei lab 
2023-2025b.]
	In the Edo era (from the early 17th centry to the mid 19th 
century), Nanae [\u4E03\u91CD] was a Japanese village.  It was 
governed by the Matsumae Domain.
	After the Meiji period, in 1870 (Meiji 3), Nanae Kan-en 
(government farm) was established by the Hokkaidou Development 
Commission.  An American advisor Edwin Dun instructed Western-style 
farming at the government farm, including dairy farming and butter 
production.  #1
  	In 1879 (Meiji 12), the administrative office (``kochou-
yakuba'') of Nanae [\u4E03\u98EF] village was established by the merger 
of Nanae and Iida [\u98EF\u7530].
	In the same year, the administrative office of Oonakayama 
[\u5927\u4E2D\u5C71] village was established by the merger of Ookawa 
[\u5927\u5DDD] and Nakajima [\u4E2D\u5CF6].
 	In 1885 (Meiji 18), Nanae village merged Oonakayama village.  
In 1902 (Meiji 35), Nanae Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established.  Nanae Station on Hokkaidou Railway (now the Hakodate Main 
Line) opened.
	In 1907 (Meiji 40), Nanae Village (1st-class municipality) was 
established.  In 1957 (Shouwa 32), Nanae Town was established.
	[See the note of Matsumae Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class 
municipalities.]

TOWN HALL, TRAFFIC, POPULATION

The town hall of Nanae is located on the south of the Hakodate Plain.  
The part of the plain is called Oono Plain.  National Route 5 (Oonuma-
kokudou) and the Hakodate Main Line run through the plain.  The part of 
National Route 5 with Akamatsu-namiki (row of red pine trees)  is 
designated as one of the 100 Roads of Japan.  #2  #3  #4
	The south part of Nanae Town is a built-up area that continues 
from Hakodate City.  The part includes Oonakayama Station on the 
Hakodate Main Line.  The population of Nanae Town increased.  Nanae is 
the second largest town (``machi'') in Hokkaidou.  (The largest is 
Otofuke Town in Tokachi sub-prefecture.)

INDUSTRY

Distinctive industries in Nanae are manufacturing, agriculture, dairy 
farming, and sightseeing.  The main manufacturing products are soft 
drinks (including Guarana [Guaran\u00E1]), wine, and semiconductors.  
STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = pasture 669 hectares in 2015, paddy rice 
400, fodder 280, carrots 210, green onions 114, radishes 89, 
	(continued) --> orchards 60, flowers 22 (carnations and other 
flowers), spinach 18, beans (soybeans 9, adzuki beans 4, other beans 
4), tomatoes 11, cabbage 8, cucumbers 8, onions 3, broccoli 3, 
 	(continued) --> apples X (concealed), other vegetables 91+X 
(sweet corn, pumpkins, asparagus), and other grains 3; dairy cows 1,988 
head in 2015 and hens 12,800.  #5
	As for sightseeing, Oonuma has been designated as the New 
Three Scenic Views of Japan.  Niyama Ski Ground is located next to 
Niyama Station.  #6  #7  #8

NOTE
 
#1  As for Nanae Governmental Farm, in 1863, the Gaertner brothers 
rented the land and started Western-style farming.  They came from 
Prussia (now Germany).  The area of their farm was 990 hectares.  Cf. 
Hokkaidou University Ranch is 470 hectares.
	[See Shin-hidaka Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture for Hokkaidou 
Univeristy Ranch.] 
	The Gaertner brothers primarily engaged in trade and 
consulship.  They also cultivated apples, pears, gooseberries, 
cherries, and vegetables.  The apples were the first Western varieties 
cultivated in Japan.  The brothers taught Western-style farming to 
neighboring farmers.
	The Gaertner brothers sold food to foreign ships in the Port of 
Hakodate.  There are no photographs or paintings of the brothers.
 	The brothers planted beech trees.  The trees became a forest 
along National Route 5.  Beech trees were used for grazing pigs 
in their home country.  Beech trees have acorns.  (The meat of the wild 
boars [``inoshishi] that ate acorns is good.)
 	In 1870 (Meiji 3), the Gaertner brothers' farm was closed.  On 
the site, Nanae Government Farm (Nanae-kan-en) opened.  The Meiji 
government bought the land back.
	To introduce Western-style farming to Hokkaidou, the Meiji 
government established five government farms in Tokyo and Hokkaidou.  
The locations were Aoyama and Azabu in Tokyo, and Nanae, Sapporo, and 
Nemuro in Hokkaidou.  Among them, Nanae Government Farm was the 
largest.
	An English writer Isabella Lucy Bird visited Nanae Government 
Farm in 1878.  She reported the scenery like this; ``The farm looked 
like a Western country.  It had Western-style buildings such as animal 
stables, a large watermill, and a butter factory.''
	[See Mori Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for Isabella Lucy 
Bird.]
	In 1882, the Hokkaidou Development Commission was abolished. 
Nanae Government Farm was gradually sold off and closed in 1894.  Only 
its stone wall remains near Nanae Elementary School.
 
#2  Mt. Nanae (779 meters) rises near the town hall of Nanae.  The 
night view of Hakodate from Mt. Nanae is called Hakodate-ura-yakei 
(another side of Hakodate night view).

#3  Oonuma Station on the Hakodate Main Line is a junction between 
Oonuma main route and Sawara branch route.  Another branch route exists 
between Oonuma Station and Nanae Station.  It is Fujishiro branch 
route, which was built by Japanese National Railways in 1966 to 
increasing transport capacity.  It was planned before motorization.
	[See Mori Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for Sawara branch 
route.  See the note of Otobe Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 
motorization.]

#4  Red pine trees (``aka-matsu'') along National Route 5 are large.  
They ere reminiscent of old trails in Honshuu island.  In 1876 (Meiji 
9), the red pine trees were transplanted from Go-ryou-kaku Castle to 
the roadside.
	 The purpose of transplantation was to make a scenic road 
before Emperor Meiji visited Nanae Government Farm.  Cf. Cherry trees 
along Nijikken Road were also transplanted to welcome the Emperor.  
	[See Uryuu Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for red pine trees.  
See Shin-hidaka Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture for Nijjikken Road.]
 
#5  During lectures at Hokkaidou University, some students are drinking
Guarana.  Guarana [Guaran\u00E1] is a popular drink in Brazil.  It is 
like Brazilian Coca-cola.
	Guarana is made from the berries of Guarana trees.  The berries 
are small and red.  Guarana trees are native to the Amazon region, 
which includes the world's largest tropical rainforest.
	After World War II, Coca-cola became popular in Honshuu island. 
Before the American product landed in Hokkaidou island, a company in 
Nanane started to produce and sell Guarana.  It is still popular in 
Hokkaidou.
	During a lecture, when I saw a student drinking a can of 
Guarana, I would tell this story;
	``Japanese people pronounce Guarana as `ga-ra-na.'  It is like 
English.  In Brazil, the original place of Guarana, people pronounce it 
`gu-a-ra-na.'  It is like Latin.
	When I ordered Guarana in a jet plane in Brazil, I said `Ah, 
ga-ra-na.'  Then, the stewardess gave me a bottle of water.  It may 
have sounded `Agua, ne?' (Water, OK?).''
 
#6  These are the New Three Scenic Views of Japan; Mihono-matsubara in 
Shizuoka Prefecture (Honshuu island), Yabakei in Ooita Prefecture 
(Kyuushuu island), and Oonuma in Hokkaidou Prefecture (Hokkaidou 
island).  They were designated in 1915 (Taishou 4).
	(Nowadays, they are not new.  Japanese people like putting 
``new'' to things.  They also like ``top-three things.'')
	The original Three Scenic Views are located in Honshuu island. 
They are Matsushima in Miyagui Prefecture (Pacific Ocean), Amano-
hashidate in Kyouto Prefecture (the Sea of Japan), and Itsukushima in 
Hiroshima Prefecture (the Seto Inland Sea).
	The original Three Scenic Views were selected in 1643, during 
the Edo era.  At the time, the Tokugawa Shogunate ruled the country and 
ordinary people could not travel freely.

#7  Oonuma Quasi National Park includes Lake Oonuma, Lake Konuma, and 
Lake Junsai.  The shapes of the lakes were formed by the eruption of 
Mt. Komagatake in 1640.
	In Lake Oonuma, smelt and shrimp are caught.  In Lake Junsai, 
Junsai (buds of watershield) is harvested.  Junsai is tasty in Dashi 
soup.  Dashi soup is a transparent soup made from Konbu kelp and 
Katsuo-bushi (shaved dried bonito).
	In the end of the Edo era, Lake Oonuma was opened to foreigners 
for walking.  In the Meiji period, an ice factory was built on the 
shore of Lake Oonuma.  The factory cut ice cubes from Lake Oonuma in 
winter.  The ice cubes were stored until summer and shipped from 
Hakodate to Tokyo. [By Professor Katsuhiko Yamashita at the Meeting of 
Hokkaidou Geographical Society in 2014.]
	The story of ice factory reminds me of the etymology of Nanae,
which means ``cold stream.''  Ice was expensive in summer in the past. 
	After the 1960s, villas were developed on the slope from Lake 
Oonuma to Mt. Komagatake.  Aerial photographs show roundabouts and 
``cul-de-sac'' in the area.  (A cul-de-sac is a dead end that has a 
circular shape.)
	In Japanese, there are no difference between roundabout and 
rotary.  Both are called rotary.  I have never seen a roundabout or 
rotary in Honshuu island.  In Canada, I had to drive through 
roundabouts.
	[See Otaru City in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture and Kushiro City 
in Kushiro sub-prefecture for roundabout and rotary.]
	* * *
	The famous song ``Sen-no-kaze-ni-natte (Be Thousand Winds)'' 
was translated by a composer at a villa in Oonuma.  The original 
is an American poem, ``Do not stand at my grave and weep.''  
	The poem continues, ``I am not there, I am the thousand winds 
that blow.''  (I agree.  When I die and become a ghost, I will not be 
in my grave.  I will go to Daimaru department store and watch people.)

#8  This is a legend about Lake Oonuma and Mt. Komagatake; ``Masatane 
Aihara was the load of Fort Oodate in the 15th century.  The fort was 
located in what is now Matsumae Town.  Masatane Aihara came to Ezo 
island (now Hokkaidou) with Masasue Andou, Kakizaki Sueshige, and 
Nobuhiro Takeda.
	Masatne Andou was the leader of them.  He built 12 forts in Ezo 
island and returned to the main island.  Nobuhiro Takeda ended 
Koshamain's war and inherited the Kakizaki clan.  He changed his name 
to Nobuhiro Kakizaki and started to rule Ezo island.
	Masatane Aihara came into conflict with Nobuhiro Kakizaki. 
Masatane Aihara was defeated and fled to Lake Oonuma.  He drowned 
himself into the lake.  Later, the Kakizaki clan became the lord of the 
Matsumae Domain in the Edo era (from the 17th to the 19th centuries).
	Even in the Edo era, Masatane Aihara's horse was seen near Lake 
Oonuma.  The horse had a very long mane that reached on the ground.''
	This legend says that the name of Mt. Komagatake signifies the 
Masatane Aihara's ghost horse.  The name ``Koma-ga-take'' means 
``horse, of, mountain'' in Japanese.  It is generally said that the 
shape of the mountain looks like a horse.
	* * *
	The story above is a legend.  Masatane Aihara may have died 
during Koshamain's War.  The story of Aihara remind me of Yoshitsune 
legend.  Yoshitune Minamoto was killed by his elder brother Yoritomo 
Minamoto, who established the Kamakura Shogunate.
	Japanese people feel sympathy for tragic heroes.  The sympathy 
is called Hangan-biiki (or Hougan-biiki).  The word ``Hangan'' means 
the job position of Yoshitsune Minamoto.  The word ``hiiki (biiki)'' 
means sympathy.
	[See Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the old 12 
forts established by the Andou clan.  See Biratori Town in Hidaka sub-
prefecture for Yoshitsune legend.  See Niikappu Town in Hidaka sub-
prefecture for Hangan-date Rock.]

LOCATION

Shikabe [shi-ka-be] [\u9E7F\u90E8] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, 
south Hokkaidou (``dou-nan'').  The Orito River and the Tokoro River 
flow into the Pacific Ocean.  The Orito River flows from Lake Oonuma in 
Oonuma Quasi National Park.
	Mt. Komagatake (1,131 meters, volcano) stands to the north.  It 
erupted in 1929.  A large amount of pumice piled up.
	[See Nanae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for Mt. Komagatake and 
Lake Oonuma.]

NAME

The name ``Shikabe'' comes from ``sikerpe'' in Ainu language. It means 
``Amur cork tree.''  (Amur cork is called ``Kihada'' in Japanese.)
	Or, it comes from ``sike-un-pe'' in Ainu language, which means 
``carry, it, place.''  The latter signified a place where Ainu people 
got off their boats and carried their luggage.  Both signified the 
mouth of the Shikabe River.  #1

HISTORY

In 1666, during the Edo era, a hot spring was discovered by Guen-gorou 
Itou, who came from Tsugaru (now Aomori Prefecture).  He found a deer 
(``shika'') that healed its wounds in the hot spring.  It 
is the origin of Shikabe Hot Spring.  In the Edo era, fishermen 
migrated from Nanbu (now Aomori Prefecture).
 	After the Meiji period, in 1879 (Meiji 12), the administrative 
office (``kochou-yakuba'') of Shikabe village was established.  In 1906 
(Meiji 39), Shikabe Village (2nd-class municipality) was established. 
In 1983 (Shouwa 58), Shikabe Town was established.
	[See the note of Matsumae Town for 2nd-class municipality.]

TOWN HALL, TRAFFIC

The town hall of Shikabe is located near the mouth of the 
Shikabe River.  National Route 278 (Esan-kokudou) runs.  At the foot of 
Mt. Komagatake, Sawara branch route of the Hakodate Main Line runs.  It 
runs along the Pacific coast, avoiding the slope of Mt. Komagatake. 

INDUSTRY

Distinctive industries in Shikabe are fishery and tourism.  STATISTICS 
OF AGRICULTURE = pasture 52 hectares in 2015 and fodder 16; dairy cows 
- (zero) head in 2015. STATISTICS OF FISHERIES = walleye pollock 4,165 
tons in 2017, sardines 701, octopus 401, shellfish 327 (including

 	Fishing ports are located in Shikabe, Honbetsu, and Dekima 
districts.  As for sightseeing, cottages, golf courses, and a resort 
hotel are located near Shikabe Station.  (Shikabe Station is far from 
the center of the town.)
	Shikabe Roadside Station (Michino-eki-shikabe) is located on 
National Route 278.  There is a geyser that gushes hot water up to 15 
meters.  It is a part of Shikabe Hot Spring.  #2
 
NOTE
 
#1  As for the name ``Shikabe,'' which means Amur cork tree in Ainu 
language, Amur cork tree was used as a yellow dye and as an intestinal 
medicine.  Amur cork tree is called ``Ki-hada'' in Japanese.  It means 
``yellow, skin.''
	Large Amur cork trees grow on the central lawn of Hokkaidou 
University.  In 2018, during Typhoon No. 21, their large branches were 
fell.  The yellow color of their barks stood out.
 	Ainu people made ritual sticks (``inau'') from branches of 
these trees; Kihada, Yanagui (willow), Mizuki (dogwood), and Enju 
(pagoda tree).  Ainu people believe that those trees have good spirits.
	Ainu's ritual sticks can be found in Hokkaidou University.  The 
location is the Forest of Archaeological Site.  There used to be Ainu 
villages in the forest.  Ainu's ritual sticks look like dread hair. 
Japanese people make ritual sticks from Sakaki (broad-leaved evergreen 
tree).  
	[See Abashiri City in Okhotsk sub-prefecture for Enju tree.  
See Biratori Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture for Ainu culture.  See Nihei 
lab 2023-2025b for Sakaki tree.]
 
#2  As for Shiakbe Station on the Hakodate Main Line, the former name 
was Takamachi Station.  There was Shikabe Station on the Oonuma-
dentetsu Line.  Oonuma-dentetsu Line ran between 1929 and 1952 along 
the Orito River.  After the abolition of the Oonuma-dentetsu Line, 
Takamachi Station was renamed Shikabe Station.
	The name ``Takamachi'' means ``hawk catcher'' in Japanese. 
During the Edo era, hawk catchers caught hawks and falcons for 
falconry.
	[See Shiriuchi Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for falconry.]

LOCATION

Mori [mo-ri] [\u68EE] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, south 
Hokkaidou (Dou-nan).  The area faces Uchiura Bay (Volcano Bay).  The 
Nigorikawa River, the Torizaki River, and the Oshironai River flow.  
	Mt. Komagatake (1,131 meters, volcano) rises to the south.  The 
area was newly established by the merger of Mori Town and Sawara Town 
in 2005.  #2

NAME

The name ``Mori'' means ``forest'' in Japanese.  The original name was 
Oniushi.  The name ``Oniushi'' comes from ``o-ni-us-pet'' in Ainu 
language.  It means ``river mouth, tree, many, river.''  It signified 
the Torizaki River or the Mori River.
	The pronunciation of Oni-ushi sounds like ``demon, ox'' in 
Japanese.  Japanese immigrants may not have liked the name and 
translated.

HISTORY

In the 16th century, the first Japanese immigrants came from Tsugaru 
(now Aomori Prefecture).  In the Edo era, Kayabe-basho (a trading 
place) was established.  It was managed by the Matsumae Domain for 
herring fishing.  Nigorikawa Hot Spring opened in 1805 in Nigorikawa 
Caldera.  #3 
	Villages of Washinoki, Mori, and Oshironai were established in 
the Edo era.  The following is the history of Mori Town after the Meiji 
period;

OLD MORI TOWN; In 1880 (Meiji 13), an administrative office (``kochou-
yakuba'') was established in Washinoki [\u9DF2\u30CE\u6728] village.  
It covered villages of Ebiya [\u86EF\u8C37] and Ishikura [\u77F3
\u5009].
	In 1881 (Meiji 14), the administrative office of Mori village 
was established.  It covered villages of Oshironai [\u5C3E\u767D\u5185] 
and Shukunobe [\u5BBF\u91CE\u8FBA]. 
	In 1899 (Meiji 22), Mori village merged Washinoki village.  The 
administrative office covered six villages of Mori, Oshironai, 
Shukunobe, Washinoki, Ebiya, and Ishikura.  In 1902 (Meiji 35), Mori 
Village (2nd-class municipality) was established.  #4
	In 1903 (Meiji 36), Mori Station on Hokkaidou Railway (now the 
Hakodate Main Line) opened.  In 1907 (Meiji 40), Mori Village (1st-
class municipality) was established.  In 1921 (Taishou 10), Mori Town 
was established.
	[See the note of Matsumae Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class 
municipalities.]

OLD SAWARA TOWN; In 1880 (Meiji 13), the administrative office 
(``kochou-yakuba'') of Sawara [\u7802\u539F] village was established. 
It covered Kakeruma [\u639B\u6F97] village.  In 1906 (Meiji 39), Sawara 
Village (2nd-class municipality) was established.
	In 1927 (Shouwa 2), Sawara Station on Oshima-kaigan-tetsudou 
(Oshima Coastal Railway) opened.  It was the current Sawara branch 
route of the Hakodate Main Line.  In 1970 (Shouwa 45), Sawara Town was 
established.

TOWN HALL, TRAFFIC
The town hall of Mori is located between the Torizaki River and the 
Mori River.  National Route 278 (Esan-kokudou) branches off from 
National Route 5 (Oonuma-kokudou) near the town hall.  National Route 
278 runs along Uchiura Bay.  #5
	Mori Station on the Hakodate Main Line is the junction of 
Oonuma main route and Sawara branch route.  Heavy freight [furei't] 
trains go the branch route along the bay.  #6

INDUSTRY

Distinctive industries in Mori are fishery, agriculture, animal 
husbandry, food processing, and geothermal power generation.  
STATISTICS OF AGRICUTURE = pasture 471 hectares in 2015, beans 
(soybeans 184, adzuki beans 101, other beans 15), potatoes 225, paddy 
rice 207, sugar beets 119, wheat 69, radishes 50, fodder 42,

(concealed); hogs and pigs 73,493 head in 2015 (the largest in 
Hokkaidou), dairy cows 238, and hens 1,200.  STATISTICS OF FISHERIES = 
sardines 7,668 tons in 2017, walleye pollock 3,251, 
	(continued) --> right-eye flounder 1,328, squid (flying squid 
726, other squid 14), mackerel 578, shellfish (scallops [cultured] 161, 
other shellfish 198), octopus 254, salmon 242, shrimp/prawns 169

atka mackerel 3, sea trout 2, Kichiji 2, Hatahata 2, congers 1, marine 
mammals 2, other fish 481, and other marine animals 66.  #7  #8
	At Nigorikawa district, farmers cultivate Onsen Tomato (hot-
spring tomatoes).  The tomatoes are grown in the greenhouses that are 
heated by hot spring water.  [By Katsuki Umeda 2007.  Development and 
sustainability of vegetable farming in geothermal greenhouses. 
``Geographical Review of Japan''  http://doi.org/10.4157/grj.80.225]
	[See Biratori Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture for tomato 
production.]
	As for sightseeing, Mori Station is the birth place of Ika-
meshi (squid rice).  Squid rice became famous all over the country for 
department stores' station-lunch festivals.  #9

NOTE

#1  Mori Town belongs to Kayabe county (Kayabe-gun). The name 
``Kayabe'' comes from ``kaya-un-pe'' in Ainu language.  It means 
``sail, exist, place.''  It signified Mt. Komagatake.  Ainu people 
viewed the shape of the mountain as a sailing ship.
	[See Nanae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for Mt. Komagatake.]
	The Hazard Map of Komagatake Volcano was published in 1983.  It 
was the first volcano hazard map in the country.  The map included the 
towns of Mori, Shikabe, and Nanae.  Today, each municipality publshes 
own hazard map.
	Who makes hazard maps?  The answer is consulting companies. 
They are the main employers of graduates from geological and 
geographical faculties. [By Kazutaka Mannen 2020.  ``Volcanoes as seen 
from cutting-edge science'' Bestbook (written in Japanese).]  Many of 
my classmates work for consulting companies.

#2  The pronunciation of ``Mori Town'' in Japanese is ``Mori-machi.'' 
Other towns in Hokkaidou are pronounced ``-chou,'' for example, 
Kayabe-chou and Yakumo-chou.
	The municipality decides the pronunciation.  It is said that 
``-machi'' is located mainly in eastern Japan and ``-chou'' is located 
mainly in western Japan.  According to the Chuu-nichi Shinbun 
(20210719), the town hall surveyed old telegrams and old gazetteers, 
and decided the name ``Mori-machi'' in 1987.
	Cf. The former Ishikari 10 towns in Ishikari City are mixture 
of ``-machi'' and ``-chou.''
	[See Ishikari City in Ishikari sub-prefecture for the former 
Ishikari 10 towns.]
	The river name ``Torizaki'' comes from ``torii (shrine gate)'' 
in Japanese.  There was a shrine in the forest.  It had many Torii 
gates.  The place was called Torii-ga-saki (shrine gate, of, cape).
	On the map published by Takeshirou Matsuura in 1859 (http://
koukita.github.io/touzaiezo/map/), the river is written as Torisaki-
kawa.
	[See Setana Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for Japanese river 
names.]
  
#3  The first immigrants came to Sawara (now Mori Town) from Kanita 
in 1532.  Kanita was located what is now Sotogahama Town in Aomori 
Prefecture) in 1532.  [By ``Sawara-chou-shi (Sawara Town history)'' 
published in 2000.]
	The former Sawara Town has a long history of Japanese 
immigrants, therefore, the origin of the name is unclear.  These are 
estimations from the book ``Sawara-chou-shi'';
	(1) The name (Sawara) comes from ``sar'' in Ainu language.  It 
means ``reed.''  (2) The name comes from ``sarki'' in Ainu language.  
It also means ``reed.''  (3) The name comes from ``sawara (suna-
hara)'' in Japanese.  It means ``sandy, field.''

#4  In the beginning of the Meiji period, the former Tokugawa Shogunate 
forces landed on the coast of Washinoki.  It was the beggining of the 
Hakodate War.  (The Hakodate War was the final phase of the Boshin 
War.)
	The commanding officers of the Tokugawa Shogunate were Takeaki 
Enomoto and Toshizou Hijikata.  They were aboard the battleships Kaiyou 
and Kaiten.  Kaiyou was made in the Netherlands.  Kaiten was made in 
Prussia (now Germany).
 	The landing took place on December 4th, 1868.  A strong wind 
was blowing on the day.  The local wind is called Taba-kaze.
	(The battleship Kaiyou was sunk in Esashi.  The battleship 
Kaiten was sunk in Hakodate.  See Easahi Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture 
for the local wind Taba-kaze.)
	[See Esashi Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the battleship 
Kaiyou.  See Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the Boshin 
War.]

#5  National Route 5 runs along a railway.  The national highway 
connects Hakodate and Sapporo.  The road opened in 1873 (Meiji 6).  At 
the time, the road was called Sapporo-hondou (Sapporo Main Road).  It 
crossed Uchiura Bay (Volcano Bay) from Mori to Muroran by ferry.
	In 1878 (Meiji 11), a British writer, Isabella Lucy Bird, 
stayed at an inn in Mori.  She was traveling from Hakodate to Biratori 
to see Ainu culture.  She documented Mori like this, ``Mori is a large 
village in the south of Volcano Bay, however, the houses are about to 
collapse at any moment.''  But she liked the view from the inn.
	[See Nanae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture, Toyoura Town in Iburi 
sub-prefecture, and Biratori Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture for the 
British writer.]

#6  The Sawara branch route of the Hakodate Main Line connects Mori 
Station and Oonuma Station.  It passes through the former Shikabe Town. 
During the Second World War, the branch route was constructed to 
increase transportation capacity.
	It was constructed using two existing railroads; Oshima-
kaigan-tetsudou (Oshima Coastal Railway) and Oonuma-dentetsu (Oonuma 
Electric Railway).  In June 1945, the branch route opened.  In August 
1945, Japan surrendered to the war.

#7  As for animal husbandry in Mori, there are swine farms managed by 
NH Foods (Nippon Ham Foods).  The company's processing plant is located 
in neighboring Yakumo Town.  As for food processing, Nichirei Foods 
produces croquettes and minced cutlets.  Maruha Nichiro produces salmon 
flakes and minced chicken.
	In the garden of Nichirei Foods, there is a monument that 
commemorates the birth place of frozen food in Japan.  The frozen food 
business started in 1920 (Taishou 9).
	At the time, Kuzuhara-shoukai (now Nichirei Foods) produced 
frozen fish using a charcoal gas engine.  The frozen fish was sold in 
Tokyo.  The company's freezing plant was constructed by American 
father-and-son engineers. The company owned reefer ships.
	* * *
	Regarding frozen food, the first home refrigerator was sold by 
GE (General Electric) in the USA in the 1920s.  After the 1960s, 
Japanese companies produced a lot of refrigerators.
	My parents used a Hitachi refrigerator for 50 years.  The next 
refrigerator was broken in two years.  Nowadays, companies pursue 
profit.  Never broken refrigerators are bad for them.

#8  As for power generation in Mori Town, Hokkaidou Electric Power 
(Hokuden) runs a geothermal power plant. It is located on the slope 
of Nigorikawa caldera.  Geothermal power generation is suitable to the 
volcanic country.  There is no fuel cost.
	However, geothermal power generation has these disadvantages; 
(1) The output is small compared to the size of the building.  (2) 
Construction costs are high.  (3) Many volcanoes are located in 
national parks, therefore, nature conservation laws restrict the 
construction. 

#9  Abe-shouten (Abe Store) started to sell Ika-meshi (squid rice) at 
Mori Station in 1941.  It was during the Second World War.  All trains 
stopped at Mori Station, because the location was the junction of the 
Hakodate Main Line and the Oshima Coastal Railway (Oshima-kaigan-
tetsudou).
	Squid rice became popular among young soldiers who stationed in 
Hokkaidou.  At the time, the catch of flying squid was good.  Also, 
squid rice can be cooked with a small amount of rice.  During the war, 
rice distribution was controlled.
	Nowadays, many companies sell squid rice.  The original Abe-
shouten's squid rice was not sold at sourvenir shops, because the 
expiry date was one day.  It was sold through demonstration sales at 
department stores. 
	The original Abe-shouten's squid rice became vacuum packed in 
2016.  Souvenir shops at Sapporo Station and New Chitose Airport 
started selling the original squid rice.  Incidentally, squid-shaped 
potteries of 4000-year-old were excavated in Mori Town in 2002.
	* * *
	As for department stores, there used to be department stores in 
front of major stations.  Nowadays, large shopping malls stand in the 
former paddy fields.  Your grandmother will remember shopping at 
department stores.  Department stores also conducted out-of-store sales 
(``gaishou'').

LOCATION

Yakumo [ya-ku-mo] [\u516B\u96F2] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, 
south Hokkaidou (``dou-nan'').  The area crosses the narrow part of the 
Oshima Peninsula.  It faces Uchiura Bay (Funka-wan) and the Sea of 
Japan.  The name ``Funka-wan'' is a translation of ``Volcano Bay'' into 
Japanese. 
	[See Oshima sub-prefecture for Volcano Bay.]
 	The area was newly formed by the merger of Yakumo Town and 
Kumaishi Town in 2005.  The former Yakumo Town was located along 
Uchiura Bay on the Pacific Ocean side.  The former Kumaishi Town was 
located along the Sea of Japan.

NAME

The name ``Yakumo'' is Japanese, which means ``overlapping clouds.''  
It was named by Yoshikatsu Tokugawa, who was the founder of Tokugawa 
Farm.  He quoted the name from the oldest poem.  (Tokugawa Farm was the 
birthplace of Hokkaidou's famous souvenirs; butter candy and carved 
wooden bear [a bear eating a salmon].)  #1
	The name ``Kumaishi'' comes from ``kuma-us-i'' in Ainu 
language.  It means ``fish drying site, many, place.''  The Kanji 
characters for Kumaishi [\u718A\u77F3] mean ``bear, stone.''
	With the merger of two towns (Yakumo and Kumaishi) in 2005, 
Futami county was newly established.  The name ``Futa-mi'' is Japanese, 
which means ``two seas.''
 
HISTORY

In the early Edo era, the Matsumae Domain built a guardhouse (``ban-
sho'') in Kumaishi on the Sea of Japan side.  It was the northern end 
of Japanese territory.  
	On the Pacific Ocean side, there were trading places 
(``basho'').  They were located in Nodaoi [\u91CE\u7530\u8FFD] and 
Yuurappu [\u904A\u697D\u90E8].
 	In the mid Edo era, the Matsumae Domain built a fort in 
Yamukushinai (later called as Yamakoshinai [\u5C71\u8D8A\u5185]).  It 
became the northern end of Japanese territory on the Pacific Ocean 
side.
	Then, the trading place of Yuurappu was renamed Yamakoshinai.
The main village was moved from Nodaoi to Otoshibe [\u843D\u90E8] due 
to an increase in fishing immigrants.  (On the Hakodate Main Line, 
there are Otoshibe Station, Nodaoi Station, and Yamakoshi Station [the 
former Yamakoshinai Station]).
	The following is the history of Yakumo Town after the Meiji 
period;

OLD YAKUMO TOWN; In 1872 (Meiji 5), Yamakoshinai branch of the 
Hokkaidou Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi) was established.  In 
1878 (Meiji 11), Tokugawa Farm opened.  In 1879 (Meiji 12), 
administrative offices (``kochou-yakuba'') were established in 
Yamakoshinai and Otoshibe villages. 
	In 1890 (Meiji 23), the administrative office of Yamakoshinai 
village was moved to Yakumo village.  In 1902 (Meiji 35), Yakumo 
Village (2nd-class municipality) was established. 
	[See the note of Matsumae Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class 
municipalities.]
	In 1903 (Meiji 22), Yamakoshinai Station and Yakumo Station on 
the Hokkaidou Railway (now the Hakodate Main Line) opened.  In 1907 
(Meiji 40), Yakumo Village (1st-class municipality) was established.  
In 1915 (Taishou 4), Otoshibe Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established.  
	In 1919 (Taishou 8), Yakumo Town was established.  In 1957 
(Shouwa 32), Yakumo Town merged Otoshibe Village.

OLD KUMAISHI TOWN; In 1973 (Meiji 6), administrative offices (``kochou-
yakuba'') were established in villages of Kumaishi, Ainumanai [\u76F8
\u6CBC\u5185], and Tomarikawa [\u6CCA\u5DDD]. Those were a continuation 
of village chiefs system from the Edo era.
	In 1902 (Meiji 35), the three villages were merged and Kumaishi 
Village (2nd-class municipalities) was established.  In 1962 (Shouwa 
37), Kumaishi Town was established.  Herring fishing flourished in 
Kumaishi from the Edo era to the Meiji period.  The peak of Kumaishi's 
population was 10,049 in 1962 (Shouwa 37).  

TOWN HALL, TRAFFIC

The town hall of Yakumo is located near the mouth of the Yuurappu 
River.  It was the former Yakumo Town's town hall.  National Route 277 
(Unseki-kokudou) branches off from National Route 5 (Oonuma-kokudou) 
near the town hall.  The Hakodate Main Line runs along Uchiura Bay.  #2

INDUSTRY

Distinctive industries in Yakumo are animal husbandry, agriculture, 
fishery, and meat processing.  STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = pasture 
4,360 hectares in 2015, fodder 989, paddy rice 338, potatoes 90 
(including seed potatoes), adzuki beans 67, soybeans 51, green onions 
20 (mainly Nanpaku-negui), flowers 3, spinach 1, tomatoes 1, 
	(continued) --> other vegetables 95+X (pumpkins, sweet corn), 
and other grains 11; dairy cows 9,111 head in 2015, beef cattle 4,893, 
and hens 1,800.  STATISTICS OF FISHERIES = right-eye flounder 642 tons 
in 2017, salmon 403, squid (flying squid 248, other squid 1), Konbu 
kelp 178, walleye pollock 156, shellfish 144, shrimp/prawns 81, 
	(continued) --> octopus 66, yellowtail 52, crabs (snow crabs 
22, other crabs 16), herring 21, olive flounder 20, Pacific cod 19, sea 
urchins 18, mackerel 16, akta mackerel 15, sharks 9, sea trout 7, 
Hatahata 3, other fish 236, and other marine animals 118.  #3  #4
	As for meat processing, Japan Food Packer's Dounan Factory 
processes pork and beef.  The company is part of the Nippon Ham Group.
There was a Kentucky Fried Chicken's experiment farm.  It is now a 
tourist farm.  #5  #6
	As for sightseeing, Yakumo Hot Spring and Ken-ichi Hot Spring 
are located along National Route 277.  Guinkon-yu Hot Spring is located 
along the Otoshibe River.  The name ``Guinkon'' means silver-wedding-
anniversary in Japanese.
	In the former Kumaishi Town, Abalone Festival is held in late 
May.  I passed the festival during a bus excursion.  There were many 
cars.  The police guided them.

NOTE
 
#1  Yoshikatsu Tokugawa asked land granting for the former samurais in 
the Owari Domain (now Aichi Prefecture).  It was approved in 1879 
(Meiji 11) and Tokugawa Farm was established in Yuurappu district in 
Yamakoshinai village.  The area was 496 hectares.
	(The name ``Yuurappu'' comes from ``yu-rap'' in Ainu language.  
It means ``hot spring, down.'')
	In 1881 (Meiji 14), Yuurappu district was separated from 
Yamakoshinai village to be a village.  At the time, Yoshikatsu Tokugawa 
named the new village Yakumo.  It was named after the oldest poem in 
the country.  The lyrics are as follows;
``Yakumo-tatsu izumo-yaegaki tsumagomi-ni yaegaki-tsukuru 
  sono-yaegaki-wo.''
  (Overlapping clouds stand, fences within fences in Izumo, to live 
   with my wife, make fences within fences, the fences within fences).
	It is said that the poem was read by Susanoo-no-mikoto, who was 
a god of mythology.  The lyrics are mysterious.  Actually, it is an old 
song for weddings.
	Tokugawa Farm started Western-style agriculture including dairy 
farming.  In winter, farmers in Tokugawa Farm sculpted wooden bears. 
The carved bears became a famous souvenir from Hokkaidou.  The 
prototype is a carved wooden bear that Yoshichika Tokugawa brougt back 
from Switzerland as a souvenier.
	In 1927 (Shouwa 2), Tokugawa Farm owned 5,083 hectares of land,
including forests.  Tokugawa Farm was demolished after World War II.  
The Allied Powers (US Army) ordered land reform throughout the country. 
	[See Niki Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for large farms 
during the Meiji period.]
	* * *
	Troubles over the land reform continue.  A family in a rural 
area owns 2-tan (20 ares) of paddy fields, although they do not 
cultivate.  They lend the land.
	The family was informed just before the enactment of the Land 
Reform Act, and borrowed the land.  After the enactment, the owner of 
the land had to transfer the land to the tenant farmer.  The land owner 
says, ``I hate them so much.  I want to kill them.'' 
 
#2  National Route 277 crosses Unseki Pass and reaches Kumaishi.  The 
pass divides Pacific Ocean side and the Sea of Japan side.  The name 
``Un-seki'' means ``cloud, stone'' in Japanese.  It signifies 
``un (kumo)'' in Yakumo and ``seki (ishi)'' in Kumaishi.
	The town hall of the former Kumaishi Town was located in the 
Sea of Japan side.  National Route 229 (Hiyama-kokudou) passes along 
the coast.  It takes about an hour by car to reach the current town 
hall.  There were many reasons for the merger across sub-prefectures.  

#3  During the Taishou period (1912-1926), farmers in Yakumo cultivated 
mainly potatoes.  The potatoes were processed into potato starch, which 
was for export to abroad.  The export of potato starch declined due to 
the Great Depression.  Dairy farming increased after the 1930s. 
	Nowadays, Yakumo is the main dairy farming region in south 
Hokkaidou.  The main breed of dairy cow is Holstein.  It is the largest 
breed among cows and cattle.  (Cows are for milk and cattle are for 
beef.) 
	Holstain has black and wihte skin.  Holstain was called 
``roppaku-gyuu'' in Japanese.  It means ``six, white, cow.''  There are 
six white spots around its nose.
	[See Eniwa City in Ishikari sub-prefecture for dairy cow.]

#4  As for fishery in Yakumo, the main catches in Pacific Ocean side 
are farmed scallops, salmon, right-eye flounder, and farmed Konbu kelp. 
	The main catches in the Sea of Japan side are walleye pollock, 
squid, and farmed abalone.  Deep sea water is used for the abalone 
culture.  Deep sea water is rich in minerals and low in bacteria. 
	Abalone is called ``awabi'' in Japanese.  It is expensive.  The 
shell is hard.  Inside the shell there is mother-of-peal (``shinju-
sou'').  The shell has holes.  The holes are used for breathing.  They 
are not eyes, although scallops have eyes.

#5  As for chicken, I think chicken tastes better in Hokkaidou. 
Chickens can grow healthy under a cool climate, without sweating.
	In Hokkaidou, fried chicken is called ``zangui.''  The word 
would have come from Chinese.  In Japanese, fried chicken is generally 
called ``kara-ague.''  It means ``Tang (old China), deep fried.''

#6  A meat processing factory is located in Yakumo Town.  Swine farms 
are located in mountainous areas in Mori Town and Imakane Towns.  In 
the past, Brazilians worked at the meat processing factory.  There was 
a Brazilian restaurant in the center of Yakumo Town.
	Masao Kanamori who instructed brass band at a local high school 
said; ``I sometimes went to the Brazilian restaurant.  Then, I was 
hooked on bossa nova.''
	Students who played musical instruments at University of 
Tsukuba also recommended ``Aguas de marco [\u00C1guas de mar\u00E7o] 
[agua-su-de-maru-so].''  It is a bossa nova song from Rio de Janeiro. 
The title means ``Waters of March.''  (The name ``Rio de Janeiro'' 
means ``River, of, January.'')

LOCATION

Oshamanbe [o-sha-ma-n-be] [\u9577\u4E07\u90E8] is a town in Oshima 
sub-prefecture, south Hokkaidou (``dou-nan'').  (The official spelling 
is ``Oshamambe.'')  It is located in the root of the Oshima Peninsula. 
The area faces Uchiura Bay.  The rivers of Oshamanbe, Monbetsu, and 
Kun-nui flow.  #1  #2  #3

NAME 

The name ``Oshamanbe'' is derived from ``o-samam-pet'' in Ainu 
language, which means ``river mouth, bend, river.''  Or, it is derived 
from ``o-samampe'' in Ainu language, which means ``river mouth, 
flatfish.'' 

HISTORY

During the Edo era, in 1669, the Ainu forces from Hidaka to Matsumae.  
It was the revolt of Shakushain (Shakushain-no-tatakai).  The leader of 
the Ainu forces was Shakushain.  The Ainu forces were defeated by the 
gun corps of the Matsumae Domain along the Kun-nui River. #4 
	In 1773, the Matsumae Domain built a guardhouse (``ban-sho'') 
and Inari Shrine.  (Incidentally, in 2022, water gushed out from the 
Inari Shrine's grounds up to a height of 30 meters.)
	In 1864, the trading place (``basho'') of Yamakoshinai was 
abolished, and Yamakoshinai village and Oshamanbe village were 
established.  Yamakoshinai was located in what is now Yakumo Town.
	After the Meiji period, in 1872 (Meiji 5), Oshamanbe branch of 
Hakkaidou Development Commission was established.  In 1873 (Meiji 6), a 
village chief (``kochou'') was appointed.  It was a continuation of 
village chief system from the Edo era.  In 1903 (Meiji 36), Oshamanbe 
Station on the Hokkaidou Railway opened (now the Hakodate Main Line).  
	In 1906 (Meiji 39), Oshamanbe Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established.  In 1923 (Taishou 12), Oshamanbe Village (1st-class 
municipality) was established.  The Nagawa Line opened (now the Muroran 
Main Line).  Oshamanbe Station became a junction.  In 1943 (Shouwa 18), 
Oshamanbe Town was established.
	[See the note of Matsumae Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class 
municipalities.]

TOWN HALL, TRAFFIC

The town hall of Oshamanbe is located near the mouth of the Oshamanbe 
River.  National Route 37 (Shizukari-kokudou) branches off from 
National Route 5 (Oonuma-kokudou [south] or Youtei-kokudou [north]).  
The Muroran Main Line branches off from the Hakodate Main Line.
	The eastern part of the area is Shizukari Pass and Rebungue 
Pass.  They are steep sea cliffs.  The first road and railroad that 
connected Hakodate and Sapporo headed inland from Oshamanbe.  Those 
road and railroad are now National Route 5 and the Hakodate Main Line.

INDUSTRY

Distinctive industries in Oshamanbe are fishery and dairy farming.  
STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = pasture 1,412 hectares in 2015 and fodder 
239; dairy cows 2,224 head in 2015.  STATISTICS OF FISHERIES = salmon 
386 tons in 2017, shellfish 107 (mainly farmed scallop), 
	(continued) --> right-eye flounder 93, yellowtail 27, sea 
urchins 20, walleye pollock 17, crabs 10 (including horsehair crabs), 
olive flounder 13, flying squid 8, tuna 2, mackerel 1, octopus 1, 
seaweed 1, herring - (zero), other fish 38, and other marine 
animals 17.
	Fishing ports are located in Shizukari, Oshamanbe, Oonaka, and 
Kun-nui districts.  Crabs are the specialty of the town.  The lunch box 
of Oshamanbe Station is Kani-meshi (crab rice).  #7  

NOTE

#1  Oshima Peninsula is located in the south of Hokkaidou.  It can be 
defined as this; 
	``Oshima Peninsula is part of Hokkaidou island, located south 
of a line that connects Oshamanbe, Kuromatsunai Basin, and Suttsu 
Bay.''
	* * *
	As for Oshamanbe River, Natural gas is extracted in the lower 
reaches of the river.  Futamata Radium Hot Spring is located in the 
upper reaches of the river.  It is a secluded hot spring.
	As for the Kunnui River, the name comes from ``kunne-nay'' in 
Ainu language.  It means ``black, river.''  The river was black because 
it contained iron sand.  In the past, the iron sand collected in 
Oshamanbe and Yakumo was transported to steel mills in Muroran.
	[See Kyougoku Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for iron 
mining.]

#2  In Ainu language, rivers are called ``nay'' or ''pet.''  The word 
``nay'' means a stream, whose course is changeable, for example, 
Wakkanai, Utashinai, and Kikonai.
	 The word ``pet'' means a river, whose course is stable.  The 
word ``pet'' is called ``betsu'' in place names, for example, Ebetsu, 
Makubetsu, and Shibetsu.  Rivers are the source of culture.
	* * *
	Typical river names in Japanese in Hokkaidou are ``Futamata-
gawa'' (54 rivers) and ``Futamata-zawa'' (42 rivers, counted by 
Geospatial Information Authority Map in March 2025.)
	The name ``Futamata-gawa'' means ``bifurcation [bi'furu-cation] 
river.''  The name ``Futamata-zawa'' means ``bifurcation stream.'' 
Things were simple in the past.

#3  These are rivers that have funny names in Oshamanbe; (1) The 
Kyuushi-battari River, which sounds like ``sudden death river'' in 
Japanese.  (2) The Warui River, which means ``bad river'' in Japanese. 
It was bad because salmons did not appear in autumn and timbers could 
not be transported.  [By Housei Nagata 1891.  ``Hokkaidou-ezo-go-
chimei-kai (Explanation of Ezo language in Hokkaidou).'']
	Cf. The name ``Enbetsu'' in Rumoi sub-prefecture has the same 
meaning.  It comes from ``wen-pet'' in Ainu language.  It means ``bad, 
river.''  It was bad because there were few salmon.  Dried salmon was 
an important food for Ainu people during the long winter.
	* * *
	These are rivers in Hokkaidou that have funny names;
	(1) The Yarikirenai River in Yuni Town, Sorachi sub-prefecture, 
which sounds ``I cannot stand it anymore! -river'' in Japanese.  The 
name comes from ``yanke-nai'' in Ainu language.  It means ``no fish, 
stream.''
	(2) The Obake River in Urakawa Town, Hidaka sub-prefecture.  It 
means ``ghost river'' in Japanese.  Ghosts appeared along the river in 
winter.  (Usually, ghosts appear in summer in Japan.  See Urakawa 
Town.)
	(3) The Osaru River in Date City, Iburi sub-prefecture.  It 
sounds like ``a little monkey river'' in Japanese.  The name comes from 
``o-sar-pet'' in Ainu language.  It means ``river mouth, reed (`ashi'), 
river.''  Ainu people make their houses using reeds.  In the upstream 
of the Osaru River, there even is Niagara Falls.  (See Date City).
	(4) The Chiri-chiri River in Shiriuchi Town, Oshima sub-
prefecture.  It sounds ``geography, geography river'' or ``dust, dust 
river'' in Japanese.  The name comes from ``chir-chir-nay'' in Ainu 
language.  It means ``bird, bird, stream.''
	(5) The Doudoromappu River in Tsubetsu Town, Okhotsk sub-
prefecture.  It sounds like ``a muddy map river'' in Japanese.  The 
name comes from ``tu-utur-oma-p'' in Ainu language.  It means ``two, 
together, enter, river.''
	(6) The Ponkikin River in Tsubetsu Town, Okhotsk sub-
prefecture.  In Google search, ``do you mean Ponkikki?,'' which was an 
old TV show.  The name comes from ``pon-kikin'' in Ainu language.  It 
means ``small, hackberry (`ezo-no-uwamizu-zakura').''
	(7) The Kemichap River in Tsubetsu Town, Okhotsk sub-
prefecture.  It sounds like ``ketchap river.''  The name comes from 
``kene-cha-p'' in Ainu language.  It means ``alder (`hano-ki'), to 
cut, river.'' Nature is affluent in Ainu culture.
 	(8) The Bochi-no-sawa River in Oketo Town, Okhotsk sub-
prefecture.  It is a Japanese name that means ``the stream of 
cemetery.''  When I read the name, I remembered ``Boot Hill 
(cemetery)'' in the pioneering years of the USA.
	(9) Gakkari-zawa in Otaru City, Shiribeshi sub-prefecture.  It 
is a Japanese name that means ``disappointment stream.''  It was an 
old place name around Asarigawa Hot Spring.  There were hopes and 
disappointments during the pioneering years.

#4  Shakushain was a chief of Ainu people.  Before the revolt of 
Shakushain, there were conflicts between Ainu chiefs.  A rumor spread 
among Ainu people, ``an Ainu messenger who attempted to borrow weapons 
from the Matsumae Domain was poisoned to death.''
	Then, Ainu chiefs united and revolted in many places.  The Ainu 
forces attacked trading ships, gold dust gatereres, and falcon 
catchers.  They were defeated by the gun corps of the Matsumae Domain.
	Reading the history, I thought, ``People unite when they have 
a common enemy.  They could not beat Western culture (guns).''
	It is also said that the background to the revolt was the trade 
imbalance between Ainu people and Japanese people.  Also, the eruption 
of Mt. Tarumae in 1667 may have caused food shortages.
 
#5  As for the population of Oshamanbe, the percentage of residents 
aged 18 to 19 is high.  This is because there is Tokyo University of 
Science Oshamanbe Campus.  Students come in April and leave in 
February.
	The Oshamanbe campus opened in 1987.  It was during the bubble 
economy.  Baby boomers sustain the Japanese economy and their children 
(2nd baby boomers) would enter universities.
	* * *
	Looking at the map of population density in the country, 
Hokkaidou looks like a black continent (HTTP://MOOO.COM/NOTE/
INTF1.JPG).  This means that Hokkaidou has a very low population 
density.  Today, most people live in and around large cities.
	City residents consume more than they produce.  A professor who 
moved from a suburb of Tokyo to Hokkaidou said that his house sold for 
more than he paid for it. 
	As for the population in Hokkaidou, Hokkaidou University is 
like a water tower of population.  It is a large university and 
students come from all over the country and overseas.  It has about 
18,000 students.  The number is larger than most towns and villages in 
Hokkaidou.  (Tokyo Metropolitan University, where I'm working now, has 
about 8,500 students.)
	Undergraduate students live in Hokkaidou for four years and 
more.  Quite a number of them find jobs in Hokkaidou.
	* * *
	In the 1970s and the 1980s, there were international students 
from Taiwan at University of Tsukuba, where I studied.  My teachers 
taught them.  In the 1990s, our faculty had an excursion in Taiwan. 
The former international students, who were professors in Taiwan at the 
time, were very kind to us.
	In the 2000s, I did not meet an international student from 
Taiwan.  I met many Korean students.  In the 2010s, there are no Korean 
students in our regional science course.  Those countries became rich 
and young people go to the USA and Europe.
	Maybe, there is nothing to learn from this small country, even 
though many Taiwanese and Koreans visit Hokkaidou for sightseeing.  I 
talked with a professor from Beijing in 2024.  He said, ``Today, 
Chinese students also want to go the USA and European countries, but 
Japan is still popular, because tuition fees are low.''

#6  The eastern end of Oshamanbe is Rebungue Pass.  In the Edo era,
Rebungue Pass was one of the Three Difficult Passes of Ezo (old 
Hokkaidou).  The others were Saru Pass in Erimo Town (Hidaka sub-
prefecture) and Raiden Pass in Iwanai Town (Shiribeshi sub-prefecture). 
	[See Toyoura Town in Iburi sub-prefecture for Rebungue Pass.]

#7  The shape of the Port of Kun-nui is like a wine grass.  For the 
shape, fishermen can anchor their fishing boats easily.  Kun-nui is 
located at the innermost part of Uchiura Bay.  The tidal range is 
large.  A long sandy beach appears at low tide.  In the past, fishermen 
got troubled to leave the port at low tide.

LOCATION

Kaminokuni [ka-mi-no-ku-ni] [\u4E0A\u30CE\u56FD] is a town in Hiyama 
sub-prefecture, south Hokkaidou (``dou-nan'').  The area faces the Sea 
of Japan.  Forests occupy 92 percent of the area.  The Amanogawa River 
flows from Mt. Tongari.  The Ishizaki River flows from Mt. 
Dai-sen-guen.

NAME

The name ``Kami-no-kuni'' is Japanese.  It means ``upper, of, 
country.''  In the 15th century, the Andou clan in Tsugaru (now Aomori 
Prefecture) entered Ezo (now Hokkaidou Prefecture).  They called the 
western part ``Kami-no-kuni'' and the eastern part ``Shimo-no-kuni.''  
The name ``Shimo-no-kuni'' means ``country, of, lower.''
	Kami-no-kuni was near to the Andou clan's homeland.  Shimo-no-
kuni was located in what is now Hokuto and Hakodate cities.  The Andou 
clan also governed Kami-no-kuni and Shimo-no-kuni in their home land 
(now Aomori and Akita prefectures).

HISTORY

In the early 13th century, the Andou clan traded with Ainu people.  
They also managed exiles from the Kamakura Shogunate.  In the mid 15th 
century, the Nanbu clan advanced to Tsugaru, and Masasue Andou and his 
vassals escaped to Ezo.  #1
 	Masasue Andou built 12 forts in Ezo.  In the area what is now 
Kaminokuni, there were two forts; Hanazawa-date and Hiishi-date. 
Japanese settlements were built around the forts.  Those were ones of 
the oldest Japanese settlements in Ezo.  #2  #3
	[See Hakodate City and Nanae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 
the Andou clan.  See Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the 
oldest Japanese village.]
	Koshamain's War occurred in 1457.  Koshamain was an Ainu chief. 
Nobuhiro Takeda, who was a vassal of the Andou clan, ended the war.  In 
the 16th century, the main fort in Ezo moved from Kaminokuni to 
Matsumae. 
	During the Edo era (from 17th to 19th century), Kaminokuni was 
governed by the Matsumae Domain.  Kaminokuni was a village of temples, 
shrines, and fishing.
	After the Meiji period, in 1872 (Meiji 5), administrative 
offices (``kochou-yakuba'') were established in Kaminokuni and Shiofuki 
[\u6C50\u5439] villages.  Those were a continuation of village chief 
system from the Edo era.
	In 1879 (Meiji 12), three administrative offices for seven 
villages were established; One was for the villages of (1) Kaminokuni, 
(2) Kita [\u5317], and (3) Oodome [\u5927\u7559]; 
	(continued) --> One was for the villages of (4) Shiofuki and 
(5) Kinoko [\u6728\u30CE\u5B50]; One was for the villages of (6) 
Ishizaki [\u77F3\u5D0E] and (7) Chiisago [\u5C0F\u7802\u5B50].
	In 1902 (Meiji 35), Kaminokuni Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established by the merger of seven villages.  In 1967 (Shouwa 42), 
Kaminokuni Town was established.
	[See the note of Matsumae Town for 2nd-class municipality.]

TOWN HALL, TRAFFIC

The town hall of Kaminokuni is located near the mouth of the Amanogawa 
River.  National Route 228 (Matsumae-kokudou) runs along the sea.  #4  
#5
	Previously, the Esashi Line ran along the valley of the 
Amanogawa River.  It connected Esashi Station and Kikonai Station until 
2014.  The former station sites remain (when I'm writing this draft in 
2019).  There was also Amanogawa Station for sightseeing.  The name 
``Amanogawa'' means the Milky Way in Japanese.

INDUSTRY

Distinctive industries in Kaminokuni are fishing, paddy rice 
cultivation, and forestry.  STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 239 
hectares in 2015, beans (soybeans 74, adzuki beans 8, other beans 1), 
wheat 71, buckwheat 37, pasture 5, orchards 5, 
	(continued) --> fodder 4, and other vegetables 30+X (snow peas, 
asparagus, Nira [Chinese chive or gynmigit]); dairy cows X (concealed) 
in 2015.  STATISTICS OF FISHERIES = atka mackerel 130 tons in 2017, 
olive flounder 44, sea urchins 34, salmon 27, squid (flying squid 12, 
other squid 15), octopus 25, shrimp/prawns 8, Pacific cod 7, 
	(continued) --> shellfish (abalone 1, other shellfish 6), 
yellowtail 6, tuna 6, right-eye flounder 5, sharks 4, mackerel 4, 
sardines 3, sea trout 1, herring 0, other fish 23, other marine animals 
5.  #6  #7
	As for sightseeing, Joukokuji Temple is the oldest building in 
Hokkaidou.  The current building was built in 1758.  Fort Hanazawa was 
located on a hill near the center of the town.  Nowadays, windmills 
stand on the hill.  #8  #9

NOTE

#1  As for exiles in the early 13th century, thieves and pirates were 
caught in the western country . They were taken to the eastern country 
(now Kantou region).  After their trial, some of them were exiled to 
Ezo (now Hokkaidou region).
	As for the explorers of Hokkaidou, Tadataka Inou and Takeshirou 
Matsuura are foumous.  Tadataka Inou explored in 1800 to confirm the  
coastline on the map.  Takeshirou Matsuura explored in 1845, 1846, 
1849, 1856, 1857, and 1858.  He made atlas and gazetteers of Hokkaidou.
	More than five centuries before them, Japanese people lived in 
what is now south Hokkaidou.

#2  As for Koshamain's war, in 1456, an Ainu man asked a Japanese 
blacksmith to make a large knife.  The knife is called ``makiri'' in 
Japanese.
	When the knife was made, the Ainu man quarreled over the 
quality and the price. The blacksmith got angry and stabbed the Ainu 
man to death with the knife.
	Then, Ainu people united under the chief Koshamain and attacked 
Japanese people in 1457.  The Ainu forces destroyed 10 of 12 forts. 
(``Fort'' was called ``date'' in Japanese, for example, Hakodate.)
	This is a list of the 10 destroyed forts; Shinori-date (in 
what is now Hakodate City), Usukeshi-date (Hakodate City), Nakano-date 
(Kikonai Town), Wakimoto-date (Shiriuchi Town), 
	(continued) --> Onnai-date (Fukushima Town), Oyobe-date 
(Matsumae Town), Oodate (Matsumae Town), Nebota-date (Matsumae Town), 
Haraguchi-date (Matsumae Town), and Hiishi-date (Kaminokuni Town).
	Japanese people escaped to Hanazawa-date (in what is now 
Kaminokuni Town) and Mobetsu-date (Hokuto City).  In 1458, Nobuhiro 
Takeda shot Koshamain and his son to death with a bow.  The Koshamain's 
war ended.
	The conflict between Ainu people and Japanese people continued. 
Mobetsu-date was also destroyed by the Ainu forces in 1508.

#3  Masasue Andou built 12 forts in Ezo (old Hokkaidou) and returned to 
his home land.  Then, he built Hiyama Castle in what is now Noshiro 
City, Akita Prefecture.
	The Kakizaki clan and the Takeda clan were vassals of the Andou 
clan.  They stayed in Ezo.  Nobuhiro Takeda ended the Koshamain's War 
and inherited the Kakizaki clan.  He changed his family name from 
Takeda to Kakizaki. 
	Nobuhiro Kakizaki (formerly Nobuhiro Takeda) built a new fort, 
whose name was Katsuyama-date, in what is now Kaminokuni Town.  It was 
located next to Hanazawa-date, which was one the 12 forts the Andou 
clan built.
	Mitsuhiro Kakizaki was the son of Nobuhiro Kakizaki. He moved 
the main fort from Katsuyama-date to Oodate in what is now Matsumae 
Town.  His descendant, Yoshihiro Kakizaki, founded the Matsumae Domain 
in the Edo era.
	[See Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the Matsumae 
Domain.]

#4  The spelling of the Amanogawa River in Kaminokuni Town is same as 
the Milky Way.  In 1614, Geronimo de Angelis, who was a Jesuit 
missionary from Sicily island, was heading for Matsumae.  He landed in 
Kaminokuni due to a heavy storm.  Later, he drew a map of Ezo and 
marked his landing point ``Tcuga [T\u00E7uga].''
	The old name of Kaminokuni was Tsuga [\u5929\u6CB3].  The 
pronunciation of the Kanji characters changed to Amanogawa [\u5929
\u306E\u6CB3].  The original name ``Tsuga'' comes from ``to-ka'' in 
Ainu language.  It means ``pond, shore.''

#5  The built-up area of Kaminokuni faces the sea.  The Okushiri 
Earthquake occurred in July 1993.  At the time, the built-up area 
of Kaminokuni suffered very little damage from tidal waves, because 
Okushiri island acted as a shield between the epicenter and Kaminokuni. 
In Okushiri island, more than 200 people died.
	[See Okushiri Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the Okushiri 
Earthquake.]

#6  The year 1993 was a crop failure due to cold weather.  At the time, 
a crop failure division was established in the town hall of Kaminokuni. 
Rice cultivation thrived in the town.  It was like rural areas in 
Honshuu island.  
	(According to 2015 Census of Agriculture and Forestry, the area 
of rice per farm is 3.9 hectares in Kaminokuni Town.  Meanwhile, it is 
10.2 hectares in Sorachi sub-prefecture.)
	* * *
	During the crop failure, I was a university student.  I ate 
Thai rice in the canteen.  The rice was urgently imported.  Japanese 
rice production is like the Just-in-time method.  Neither farmers nor 
the government produce surplus. 
	(The Just-in-time method was adopted by Toyota Motor.  It was 
adopted during the post-war period of material shortages.  Meanwhile, 
Mass-production-method was adopted by Ford Motor in the USA.  The 
company lead the world's first motorization at the beginning of the 
20th century.)
	The year 1993 was a cold summer.  (A cols summer is called 
``reika'' in Japanese).  In the year, a large cooler was installed in 
our laboratory of geography, although we did not used it.
	When I was a child, if the temperature rose by 30 degrees 
Celsius, it was a hot day.  Nowadays, the temperature in Tokyo becomes 
above 36.5 degrees Celsius every day in summer.
	The year 2025 was a rice shortage.  It was not caused by a 
cold summer.  The summer was too hot in Tokyo.  It was caused by the 
market.  It was an imbalance between supply and demand.
	International students from Asian countries were surprised by 
the rising price of rice in supermarkets.  My wife bought Bichiku-mai 
(the government reserved rice).  Then, she bought California rice 
(Calrose).  She said, ``My pride does not allow it, but...''  (She was 
born and grown in a rural area.)  
 
#7  Edible mountain plants are called ``sansai'' in Japanese.  On May 
19, 2013, I traveled from Kikonai to Kaminokuni on a bus excursion.  I 
saw several cars parked in the mountains.  People went into the 
mountains to pick edible mountain plants.
	According to a graduation thesis submitted to Faculty of 
Letters at Hokkaidou University, fern pickers used to come Kaminokuni 
Town from Niigata Prefecture every spring.  Fern (``zenmai'' in 
Japanese) and blacken ferns (``warabi'') are typical edible mountain 
plants. 
	Fern pickers stayed in mountain huts where they collected, 
boiled, and dried ferns.  When the harvest season was over, they rented 
freight trains and shipped dried ferns to Oosaka.
	According to Takeo Ichikawa's book ``Nihon-no-shiki-to-kurashi 
(Four seasons and life of Japan)'' published in 1993, edible mountain 
plants grown in snowy regions are large and of good quality.  A family 
in Murakami (Niigata Prefecture) earned over one million yen in one 
season by picking wild edible mountain plants.  

#8  These are old buildings in Kaminokuni; (1) Joukokuji Temple, which 
is a Buddhist temple built in 1443.  That was around the year when Fort 
Hanazawa was built.  The existing building was rebuild in 1758.  The 
name ``Joukoku'' is Japanese.  The meaning is the same as 
``Kaminokuni.''  
	(2) Tategami-hachiman Shrine, which was built in 1473.  That 
was around the year when Fort Katsuyama was built.  The names 
``Tategami'' and ``Hachiman'' are Japanese.  These signify gods of war. 
The existing building was rebuild in 1699.  It was moved to the foot of 
a hill in 1895, and the name was changed to Kaminokuni-hachiman Shrine.
 	(3) The Sasanami's residence, which is the former herring 
mansion (``nishin-goten'') located in the center of Kaminokuni Town.  
It was built in the early 19th century, during the Edo era.  It is the 
oldest residence in Hokkaidou (excluding temples and shrines).
	Those buildings are designated as Important Cultural 
Properties (Juuyou-bunka-zai).  As for the oldest building in Japan, it 
is Houryuuji Temple in Nara Prefecture.  It was rebuilt in the 7th 
century.
	[See Hiyama sub-prefecture for Houryuuji temple.]
	The main buildings of temples and shrines do not have water 
facilities such as kitchens.  Therefore, temples last longer than 
ordinary houses.  
	There are many temples and shrines in traditional towns. 
Kaminokuni is one of them.  Kaminokuni was the original place of the 
Matsumae Domain.
	In the past, monks in temples and priests in shrines were like 
civil servants today.  They recorded people's names and place names.  
In addition, many people were born and many people died in the past. 

#9  There are old legends in Kaminokuni Town.  Ookura herring is one of 
them.  The story has been told since the 1590s (before the Edo era);
	``In one year, people could not catch herring until the end of 
May.  The fishing season was almost over.  At the time, an elderly 
monk, Shuukai Ookura, said to the villagers, `I will pray for herring 
to come.  If you catch herring, please share them with me.  I will 
repair my temple.'
	Villagers made a promise.  The monk tied up a sacred rope, 
fasted, and prayed.  One week later, seagulls covered the sea, Shikabe 
(albatross) gathered on the shore, whales spurted water and made big 
waves.  Schools of herring appeared.
	The catch was larger than usual years.  Villagers were very 
happy.  However, a perverse man refused to give his thanks to the monk, 
saying, `It is just late this year, not your prayer.'  He got into a 
fight with the old monk and the monk died.
	Villagers prayed to the spirit of the monk.  After the 
incident, when a small number of herring washed up on the shore in 
June, villagers called them `Ookura herring'.''
	These are other legends; ``Upside-down water pine (yew),'' 
``Beheaded pine,'' and ``The path of god.''  People may have made 
legends during the long winter.
	[See Yoichi Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture, Esashi Town, and 
Otobe Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for herring fishing.]

LOCATION

Esashi [e-sa-shi] [\u6C5F\u5DEE] is a town in Hiyama sub-prefecture, 
south Hokkaidou (``dou-nan'').  The area faces the Sea of Japan.  The 
shape of the town is like the letter ``B.''  The narrow part is the 
mouth of the Assabu River.  (Assabu Town is located in the middle and 
upper reaches of the Assabu River.)
  	As for the original vegetation, the mountains were covered with 
Hiba trees (kind of cypress).  In the Edo era, the trees were actively 
felled.  The logs were transported down the Assabu River.  The county's 
name ``Hi-yama'' is Japanese, which means ``cypress mountain.''  #1
	[See Hiyama sub-prefecture for Hiba trees.]

NAME

The name ``Esashi'' comes from ``e-sa-us-i'' in Ainu language. It means 
``head, seashore, exist, place.''  It stands for a cape.  It signified 
Kamome island in the Port of Esashi.  The etymology of Esashi is the 
same as Esashi Town in Souya sub-prefecture.  #2

HISTORY

In 1216, Ubagami-daijinguu Shrine was established.  It is one of the 
oldest shrines in Hokkaidou.  In the late 17th century, during the Edo 
era, the Matsumae Domain built a port to transport cypress.  #3  #4
	Herring fishing thrived in the Edo era.  During the season of 
herring fishing, fishermen gathered from Honshuu island to Esashi.  The 
Port of Esashi was bustling.  Esashi became one of the largest ports of 
the Matsumae Domain along with Fukuyama (Matsumae) and Hakodate.  #5
 	In 1868 (Meiji 1), during the Boshin War, the former Tokugawa 
Shogunate forces occupied Esashi.  In 1869 (Meiji 2), the Meiji 
government forces recaptured Esashi.  They advanced to Hakodate and 
defeated the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces.
	In 1872 (Meiji 5), Esashi branch of Hokkaidou Development 
Commission (Kaitaku-shi) was established.  Administrative offices 
(``kochou-yakuba'') were established for 26 towns in the built-up area 
of Esashi.  Those were a continuation of town chief system from the Edo 
era.
	In 1880 (Meiji 13), a county office (``gun-yakusho'') for 
Hiyama and Nishi [\u723E\u5FD7] counties was established.  In 1897 
(Meiji 30), Hiyama sub-prefecture (Hiyama-shichou) was established. 
The county office of Hiyama and Nihsi was abolished.
	In 1900 (Meiji 33), Esashi Town (1st-class municipality) was 
established by the merger of 26 towns in Esashi and Gokatte [\u4E94
\u52DD \u624B] village.  In 1955 (Shouwa 30), Esashi Town merged Tomari 
[\u6CCA] Village.  The shape of Tomari Village was like the letter 
``B.'' #6  #7
	[See the note of Matsumae Town for 1st-class municipality.]

TOWN HALL, TRAFFIC

The town hall of Esashi, Hiyama sub-prefectural bureau, and the Port of 
Esashi are located to the south.  The port is the terminus of National 
Route 227 (Oono-kokudou) and National Route 228 (Matsumae-kokudou).
	A ferry line connects the Port of Esashi and Okushiri island. 
Previously, the Esashi Line connected Esashi, Kikonai, and Hakodate. 
Near the mouth of the Assabu River, National Route 229 (Hiyama-kokudou) 
branches off from National Route 227.
	 National Route 229 goes north along the coast.  National Route 
227 turns east, runs along the Assabu River, crosses the ridge, and 
leads to the Oono Plain (Hakodate Plain).  It was one of the roads by 
which the Meiji government forces advanced to Hakodate during the 
Boshin War.

INDUSTRY

Distinctive industries in Esashi are fishery and sightseeing. 
STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 268 hectares in 2015, beans 
(soybeans 112, adzuki beans 20, other beans 1), potatoes 48, wheat 32, 
broccoli 21, pasture 13, fodder 7, orchards 4, flowers 3, yams 1, 
	(continued) --> tomatoes 1, other vegetables 35+X, and other 
grains 28; dairy cows X (concealed) in 2015.  STATISTICS OF FISHERIES = 
red snow crabs 438 tons in 2017, squid (flying squid 314, other 
squid 2), octopus 59, sea urchins 25, salmon 19, olive flounder 15, 
	(continued) --> yellowtail 7, atka mackerel 7, shellfish 6 
(including Ezo-baka-gai [mactra], abalone), seaweed (Konbu kelp 1, 
other seaweed 5), Pacific cod 5, right-eye flounder 4, sea trout 3, 
shrimp/prawns 3, sharks 1, herring 1, other fish 51, and other marine 
animals 20 (including sea cucumbers).
	These are tourist destinations in Esashi; (1) Kamome island, 
which means ``seagull island'' in Japanese, (2) Kaiyou Memorial Hall, 
which is a museum that recreates a sunken ship, (3) the former Nakamura 
residence, which was an old merchant's mansion, and (4) a marina in the 
Port of Esashi.  #8  #9  #10  #11
 
NOTE
  
#1  As for the vegetation in Esashi Town, Hiyama Ancient Forest (Hiyama-
koji-no-mori) is designated as National Natural Monument (Tennen-kinen-
butsu).  The forest is located near the border with Kaminokuni Town.  
It is far from the center of Easashi Town.
	The main trees in the protected forest are Hiba (kind of 
cypress) and Ao-todomatsu (Blue Sakhalin fir).  Hiba is also called 
Hinoki-asunaro.
	[See Hiyama sub-prefecture for Hinoki-asunaro.]
	Todomatsu (Sakhalin fir) and Ezomatsu (Yezo spruce) are typical 
conifers in central Hokkaidou (``dou-ou'').  Todomatsu has smooth bark 
and Ezomatsu has rough bark.
	Esasi-sou (Esashi grass) is a kind of white mullein [ma'lein].  
The plant was imported from Europe in the Meiji period.  It naturalized 
in Esashi Town after World War II.

#2  As for the name ``Esashi,'' there is another interpretation.  The 
name comes from ``e-sas-us'' in Ainu language.  It means ``eat, Konbu 
kelp, exist.''  There is a legend like this; ``Long ago, there was a 
famine [fe'-min].  Ainu people in the north coast came here.  They 
could survive by eating Konbu kelp.''
	[See Shin-hidaka Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture for Konbu kelp.]

#3  The festival at Ubagami-daijinguu Shrine has been held since 1644. 
It is one of the oldest festivals in Hokkaidou.  A high school 
teacher in Hokkaidou said, ``If you see a festival, you will know the 
culture.  Dou-nan (south Hokkaidou) is different.''

#4  Takeshirou Matsuura was an explorer in the Edo era.  He recorded 
place names and their locations in Ezo (now Hokkaidou).  He spent a 
winter in Esashi in 1846.  It was during his 2nd survey of Ezo.  He 
earned travel expenses by carving seals (``inkan'') in Esashi.
 
#5  Esashi-oiwake is a folk song from Esashi.  It was a song for 
herring fishing in the Edo era.  These are example lyrics;
``Kuniwo hanarete ah ezogashima yansano-ee, ikuyo nezameno namimakura''
  (I left the country [ah] and came to Ezo island [yansano-ee]. How 
   many nights did I wake up on the wave pillow?)
``Nani-wo yumemite nakukayo chidori nee, kokowa esashino karino yado''
  (What are you calling and dreaming, seagulls? [nee] This is a 
   temporary lodging in Esashi).''
``Esashi-no gogatsuwa edonimo naito, hokoru nishin-no haru-no umi.''
  (May in Esashi is nowhere even in Edo [now Tokyo], proud of the 
   spring sea with herring.)
	[See Yoichi town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for the song 
``Souran-bush'' that was sung during herring fishing.]
	* * * 
	In the past, herring shoals spawned off the coast of Hokkaidou 
from March to May.  Herring were processed into herring meal and 
transported to Oosaka by North-bound ship (Kitamae-bune).  Fertilizer 
wholesalers purchased herring meal.  North-bound ships departed from 
Oosaka and sailed along the Seto Inland Sea, the Sea of Japan, and 
Hokkaidou.
	In the Edo era, herring meal and dried sardines were called 
``kinpi.''  It means ``gold fertilizer'' or ``money fertilizer'' in 
Japanese.  Farmers started to buy fertilizer with money.  Previously, 
farmers used leaf litter, livestock manure, and human manure as 
fertilizers.
	``Kinpi'' was the so-called money fertilizer.  It was used for 
cultivating commercial crops such as indigo, rapeseed, and cotton. 
Those crops were mainly cultivated in western Japan.
	Herring caught in Hokkaidou was also processed into ``migaki'' 
(dried herring for eat) and transported to ``naichi (main island).''  
	[See Yoichi Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture, Otobe Town, and 
Kaminokuni Town in Esashi sub-prefecture for herring fishing.]
 
#6  As for the former Gokatte village, the Gokatte River and the Port 
of Gokatte are located south of the built-up area of Esashi.
	 Gokkate-ya-youkan is a souvenir from Esashi.  It is 
``youkan'' (sweet bean paste).  In the Edo era, Gokatte-gumi came from 
Nanbu (now part of Iwate and Aomori Prefectures).  Gokatte-gumi was a 
group of lumberjacks. 
	Gokkate-gumi fell Hiba trees.  They also succeeded in 
cultivating adzuki-beans in Ezo (old hokkaidou).  They made sweet 
adzuki-bean paste and presented it to the lord of the Matsumae Domain.
 
#7  As for the former Tomari Village in Esashi Town, the administrative 
office (``kochou-yakuba'') of Tomari village was built in 1878 (Meiji 
11).  [By ``2016 Esashi-chou-kyouiku-suishin-keikaku (2016 Esashi 
Town education promotion plan).'']  In 1906 (Meiji 39), Tomari Village 
(2nd-class municipality) was established.
	Before 1955, there were three Tomari villages in Hokkaidou. (1) 
Tomari Village in Hiyama county, Hiyama sub-prefecture.  It was merged 
to Esashi Town in 1955.  (2) Tomari Village in Furuu county.  It is 
still located in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture.  
	(continued) --> (3) Tomari Village in Kunashiri county.  It is 
located in Kunashir island.  Russians live on the island after 1945.  
It is a nominal municipality.  
	* * *
	I taught Japanese geography at Hokkaidou University.  In the 
class, a student from Russia pointed at Kunashir (Kunashiri) island on 
the map and said,  ``This map is funny.  I do not care, but Russians 
live in the island.  They feel sad if they see this map.'' 
	I replied, ``Here is a national university.  I could buy only 
this map.''  Kunashir island is a disputed island.

#8  Kamome island in Esashi is a tombolo.  The word ``tomboro'' is a 
geographic term that means a linked island.
	These are tourist sites in Kamome island; (1) Heishi Rock; It 
looks like a religious vase.  (2) Senjou-jiki; A large flat rock 
eroded by waves.  The name ``Senjou'' means 1,000 tatami mats.  (3) 
Yoshitsune-no-uma-iwa; A white rock that looks like the horse of 
Yoshitsune Minamoto. 
	(continued) --> (4) Benkei-no-ashiato; It is large two holes on 
a flat rock.  They look like footprints of Benkei Musashibou.  Benkei 
Musashibou was a monk soldier and a vassal of Yoshitsune Minamoto.  A 
hole in the rock on the coast is called ``en-kama.''
 	(continued) --> (5) Tokugawa Shogunate battery site;  The guns 
were set by the Matsumae Domain in 1852.  (6) Sand beaches; Two sand
beaches are open in summer.
	[See Biratori Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture and Otobe Town in 
Hiyama sub-prefecture for Yoshitsune legends.]

#9  Kaiyou was a battleship of the Tokugawa Shogunate.  It was made in 
the Netherlands.  During the Boshin War, the former Tokugawa Shogunate 
forces advanced from Hakodate to Matsumae, and then to Esashi.
	 The battleship Kaiyou also set sail from Hakodate to Matsumae, 
and then to Esashi.  In December 1869 (Meiji 1), after the occupation 
of Esashi, due to a strong wind, the battleship ran aground and sank.
The wind is called ``Taba-kaze (Taba wind).''  It is a local wind in 
Hiyma sub-prefecture in winter.
	Toshizou Hijikata was the commander of Tokugawa Shogunate 
forces.  He thought of the sunken ship, cried, and hit the trunk of a 
pine tree.  Later, a not appeared on the pine tree.  The not is called 
``Toshizou's fist (Toshizou-no-kobushi).''
	The pine tree is called the Pine of Lament (Nagueki-no-matsu). 
It is located in front of the old administrative office of Hiyama and 
Nishi counties.
	[See Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the Boshin 
War.]

#10  The local wind ``Taba-kaze'' sank the battleship Kaiyou.  It blows 
from the northwest in winter.  Japanese fishermen feared the wind.  
They believed that the wind had a soul.  They called the wind Tama-kaze 
(soul wind).  The pronunciation changed to Taba-kaze.
	Houses in Esashi were surrounded by fences in winter.  The 
fences were made of tree branches.  The sound of the wind hitting the 
fences was called ``Mogari-bue (Mogari, whistle).''  (The word 
``mogari'' means a fence made of tree branches or bamboo.)  That was 
the soundscape of Esashi in winter.  
	Today, windmills stand on the mountains in Esashi.  They are 
managed by Esashi Wind Power, a subsidiary of J-Power (Electric Power 
Development Company).
	These are local winds in Hokkaidou island; (1) Taba-kaze in 
Esashi Town, Hiyama sub-prefecture, (2) Dashi-kaze in Suttsu Town, 
Shiribeshi sub-prefecture, (3) Hidaka-shimo-kaze in Samani Town, Hidaka 
sub-prefecture, 
	(continued) --> (4) Shikata in Erimo Town, Hidaka sub-
prefecture, (5) Aikaze in Ishikari City, Ishikari sub-prefecture, and 
(5) Bafun-kaze in the Tokachi Plain, Tokachi sub-prefecture and other 
places.
	In the past, due to a strong wind in early spring, 60 herring 
fishing boats sank.  A novel depicts Kuma-kaze (bear wind).  When a 
man-eating bear was killed, a strong wind blew.
	[See Haboro Town in Rumoi sub-prefecture for the shipwreck.  
See Tomamae Town in Rumoi sub-prefecture for the man-eating bear.]
        * * *
        Long ago, an elderly Ainu woman lived near the Port of Esashi. 
Her name was Orii.  She lived near the Port of Esashi.  She was a 
prophet.  She predicted weather and wind.
	Orii also mentioned the size of fishing net for herring 
fishing.  The size should be 5-shaku 3-sun (160 centimeters) in height. 
It should have 63 meshes.  It meant a small net.
	During the Edo era, people followed her words.  Herring came 
every year.  After the Meiji period, people used larger nets and the 
catch of herring decreased.  Incidentally, the average height of a man 
was about 5-shaku (152 centimeters) in the Edo era.
 
#11  As for old buildings in Esashi, the former Nakamura's residence 
has been designated as an Important Cultural Property (Juuyou-bunka-
zai).  The residence was built from the end of the Edo era to the Meiji 
period.  The owner was a merchant from Oumi (now Shiga Prefecture).
	The Nakamura's residence was a shipping wholesaler.  The 
buildings of the residence are connected by passages.  The architecture 
is called kaisen-donya-kenchiku [\u56DE\u8239\u554F\u5C4B\u5EFA\u7BC9] 
(shipping wholesaler architecture).
	In the past, along the Port of Esashi, shipping wholesalers 
such as the Nakamura's residence were lined up.  The wholesalers had 
piers on the water to transport cargo to ships.
	Oumi merchants traded on ships called Kitamae-bune (North-bound 
ships).  The hometown of Oumi merchants was what is now Higashi-oumi 
City in Shiga Prefecture.  Esashi Town and Higashi-oumi City are sister 
cities. 
 	``North-bound ship'' was also called ``Sengoku-bune.''  The 
word ``sen-goku-bune'' means ``1,000-koku, ship'' in Japanese.  One 
``koku'' equals 150 kg in case of rice.  The ship could carry 150 tons 
of rice.
	One ``koku'' of rice was about one ``ryou'' of money in the mid 
Edo era.  The sales of one voyage per North-bound ship amounted to 
1,000-ryou of money in the mid Edo era.  One ``ryou'' of money was 
equivalent to about 50,000 yen today. 
	[See Otobe Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for one ``koku'' of 
herring.  See Kuriyama Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for one ``koku'' 
of rice wine.]

LOCATION

Assabu [a-ssa-bu] [\u539A\u6CA2\u90E8] is a town in Hiyama sub-
prefecture, south Hokkaidou (``dou-nan'').  Assabu is an inland town. 
The area corresponds to the basin of the Assabu River, which flows to 
the Sea of Japan.  The area of Assaabu seems to face the sea, but the 
mouth of the Assabu River is included in Esashi Town.
	As for vegetation, Assabu is the northern limit of Hiba trees 
(Hinoki Asunaro trees), which are a kind of cypress [sa'i-pruhs].  
Assabu is also the southern limit of Todo-matsu trees, which are a 
kind of fir.
	[See Hiyama sub-prefecture for Hiba tree.]

NAME

The name ``Assabu'' is derived from ``hacam-pet'' in Ainu language.  It 
means ``starling, river.''  It signified the Assabu River.  The 
etymology is the same as Hassamu in Nishi Ward, Sapporo City, Ishikari 
sub-prefecture.  #1

HISTORY

In the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain cut cypress trees after the 1670s. 
Woodcutters from the main island (now Honshuu island) immigrated.
	In the beginning of the Meiji period, in 1868 (Meiji 1), the 
Matsumae Domain established Tate Castle.  Tate Castle was located in 
the upper reaches of the Assabu River.  The castle was used during the 
Boshin War (1868-1869).  #2  #3  
	In 1876 (Meiji 9), the administrative office (``kochou-
yakuba'') of Gamushi [\u4FC4\u866B] village was established.  It was a 
continuation of village chief (``kochou'') system from the Edo era.  #4
	In 1879 (Meiji 12), the administrative office of Gamushi 
village was re-established.  That covered four villages; Gamushi, 
Tsuchihashi [\u571F\u6A4B], Mena [\u76EE\u540D], and Akanuma [\u8D64
\u6CBC].
	In 1800 (Meiji 13), the administrative office of Gamushi 
village covered five villages; Gamushi, Tsuchihashi, Mena, Akanuma, and 
An-noro [\u5B89\u91CE\u5442].  Those five villages existed in the Edo 
era for forestry. 
	In 1801 (Meiji 14), the administrative office of Gamush village 
covered seven villages; Gamushi, Tsuchihashi, Mena, Akanuma, An-noro, 
Tate [\u9928], and Uzura [\u9D89].
	In 1906 (Meiji 39), Assabu Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established by the merger of seven villages.  In 1963 (Shouwa 38), 
Assabu Town was established.
	[See the note of Matsumae Town for 2nd-class municipality.]

TOWN HALL, TRAFFIC

The town hall of Assabu is located near the confluence of the 
Assabu River and the An-noro River.  The town hall was built at the 
former site of Hiyama Agricultural Experiment Station.
	National Route 227 (Oono-kokudou) passes the center of Assabu 
town.  In the past, the national highway was called Uzura-sandou (Quail 
[kwayl] mountain trail).  It was one of the routes that the Meiji 
government forces advanced to Hakodate.

INDUSTRY

Distinctive industries in Assabu are agriculture and forestry. 
STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = beans (soybeans 484 hectares in 2015, 
adzuki beans 196, other beans 7), paddy rice 555, potatoes 489, wheat 
373, buckwheat 171, sugar beets 44, orchards 37 (grapes 21),

asparagus, sweet corn), and other grains 77; dairy cows - (zero) in 
2015.  #5
	May-queen potatoes are a local specialty.  May-queen is a 
popular cultivar along with Danshaku (baron).  The country sign 
(gateway sign) of Assabu is a May-queen boy (or girl) whose face is 
long and smooth.  #6
 
NOTE
  
#1  Stalings are called Muku-dori in Japanese.  Stalings in Japan are 
white-cheeked starlings (grey starlings).  The word ``muku-dori'' means 
``Muku tree, bird.''  Muku tree is a kind of deciduous broad-leaved 
tree.
	In Hokkaidou island, the bird is also called Sakura-dori, which 
means ``cherry tree, bird.''  The bird migrates from the south during 
the cherry blossom season.
	[See Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for cherry 
blossom.]
	When I lived in Tsukuba City, Ibaraki Prefecture, a huge flock 
of starlings covered the evening sky.  I watched it from the balcony.
The sky was filled with the birds.

#2  In the past, tree felling started in early winter.  The forest 
floor was covered with snow.  The snow provides good visibility.  
Woodcutters could move smoothly in winter.  (In summer, bamboo grass 
and grass are plentiful.) 
	Cypress trees in Hokkaido island are ``Hiba.''  Cypress trees 
in Honshu island are ``Hinoki'' and ``Hiba.''
	[See Hiyama sub-prefecture for cypress tree.]
	Woodcutters hauled logs to the river on sleighs.  Melting snow 
flooded the river in spring.  Woodcutters floated the logs down the 
river in spring.
	The woodcutter in Assabu brought Shishi-odori dance (Dear 
dance) from their homeland.  The dance became an annual event at Hiyama
guardhouse.
	Guardhouses in Ezo [now Hokkaidou] were called ``ban-sho'' in 
Japanese.  They were run by the Matsumae Domain.
	* * *
	A large forest fire occurred in 1695.  Subsequently, the 
Matsumae Domain banned logging from 1770 to 1807 to prevent 
deforestation.  A large forest fire also occurred in 1876.
	Very few natural forests remain.  Today, tourists see huge 
forests in Hokkaidou and think they are natural, however, those were 
felled and burned in the past.
	In Assabu Town, a natural forest has designated as National 
Natural Monument (Tennen-kinen-butsu) since 1928.  It is ``Uzura-gawa-
goyou-matsu-jisei-hokugen-chitai (Northern Limit of White Pine Natural 
Growing Area along the Uzura River).''
	[See Esashi Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for another natural 
forest.]
	As for snowy mountains, a female member of Hokkaidou University 
Mountaineering Club said, ``When it snows, we can go into mountains 
that we could not in summer.  In summer, bamboo grass (``sasa'') and 
dwarf pine trees (``haimatsu'') block the way.  There also are 
mosquitoes and bears in summer. 
 	As for sleigh and sled, parents move their children using 
plastic sleds in Sapporo City.  People have used sleigh and sled since 
antiquity.
	[See Naie Town in Sorach sub-prefecture for sleigh.]
 
#3  Tate Castle was built inland in 1868 (Meiji 1).  The castle was 
built inland by the Matsumae Domain to avoid naval artillery.  It was 
during the Boshin War.  The previous Fukuyama Castle (Matsumae Casle) 
was located along the coast.
	For the same reason, the capital of the Choushuu Domain moved 
from Hagui to Yamaguchi.  (Yamaguchi is the capital of Yamaguchi 
Prefecture now.)  Hagui is located along the Sea of Japan and Yamaguchi 
is located inland.  The relocation of the capital was occured in 1863. 
The Edo era, which was ruled by the Tokugawa Shogunate, ended in 1867.
	* * *
	In December 1868 (Meiji 1), the former Tokugawa Shogunate 
forces advanced to Matsumae Castle.  The Matsumae Domain's forces 
escaped to Tate Castle.  It was November by the lunar calendar 
(``taiin-reki'') used at the time.  (It was December in the solar 
calendar [``taiyou-reki''] that is used now.)  
	In Tate Castle, Mikami Choujun fought using a cutting board as 
a shield.  He a monk soldier of the Matsumae Domain.  He was killed to 
allow his allies [a'laiz] to escape.  Tate Castle was captured and 
burned by the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces.
	The lord of the Matsumae Domain somehow managed to find a ship 
in Kumaishi.  He and his family set sail to the rough winter sea.  They 
headed for Hirosaki.  Then, the Matsumae Domain's forces surrendered. 
(Kumaishi district is located in Yakumo Town.)
	In May 1869 (Meiji 2, solar calendar), the Meiji government 
forces landed near the mouth of the Himekawa River.  The Meiji 
government forces advanced south and occupied Esashi.  (The Himekawa 
River is located in Otobe Town.)
	In June 1869, the Meiji government forces advanced to Hakodate 
and ended the Boshin War.  The month was May by the lunar calendar 
used at the time.
	[See Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the Boshin 
War.]
	After the Boshin War, the Matsumae Domain was renamed the Tate 
Domain.  In August 1871 (Meiji 4, solar calendar), all domains in Japan 
were abolished.  Prefectures were established.  In Hokkaidou, Tate 
Prefecture was established in the south.  The other areas were governed 
by the Hokkaidou Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi). 
	In October 1871 (solar calendar), Aomori Prefecture merged Tate 
Prefecture.  In 1872 (Meiji 5), the Hokkaidou Development Commission 
governed the whole Hokkaidou, including the area of the former Tate 
Prefecture.
	Meiji was a turbulent period.  After a turbulent period, 
new religions expands.
	[See Hokkaidou University in Kita Ward, Sapporo City, Ishikari 
sub-prefecture, for new religion.]
  
#4  As for the name ``Gamushi,'' there is Gamushi Hot Spring along the 
tributary of the An-noro River.  The name ``Gamushi'' comes from 
``kamuy-us-i'' in Ainu language.  It means ``god, exist, place.''  The 
word ``god'' in the name means bear.  Ainu people considered bears to 
be gods.
	[See Noboribetsu City in Iburi sub-prefecture for bear.]
  
#5  Local specialties of Assabu Town are Hikari-kuro-daizu (shining 
black soybeans) and Kuro-mame-purin (black-bean pudding).
	When I conducted field survey in Hokkaidou in the 2000s, I 
heard that black soybeans are fit for machine harvesting.  The black 
color hides the stains that gets splashed onto the beans when 
mechanical harvesters cut the stems.  It was around the time that 
mechanized soybean harvesting started.  [By T. Nihei 2007.  The

#6  The potato cultivar ``May-queen'' was bred in 1900 by the British 
seed company Sutton & Sons.  May-queen was named after the queen who 
was chosen at the May Day festival.
	May-queen was imported to Japan from the USA during the Taishou 
period (1912-1925).  In 1928 (Shouwa 3), Hiyama Agricultural Experiment 
Station designated May-queen and Danshaku as recommended potato 
cultivars.  Hiyama Agricultural Experiment Station was located in 
Gamushi district, Assabu Village. 
	[See Imakane Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture and Kucchan Town in 
Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for Danshaku potatoes.]

	May-queen is a popular ingredient in Oden (winter pot dish) in 
the Kansai region.  (Kansai is located in the central part of Japan. 
It is considered as ``western Japan [nishi-nihon].'')  May-queen 
potatoes do not fall apart when they are soaked in hot soup for a long 
time.  I grew up in eastern Japan and have never seen potatoes in Oden.
	* * *
	Sapporo Shusei is a distilling company.  The head office of 
Sapporo Shusei is located in Nishi Ward, Sapporo City, Ishikari sub-
prefecture.  The main factory of Sapporo Shusei is located along the 
Assabu River.
	Sapporo Shusei in Assabu Town makes Shouchuu (liquor).  The 
liquor is distilled from potatoes and sweet potatoes, which are 
cultivated in south Hokkaidou.  Next to the distilling factory is a 
potato shipping center that is run by agricultural cooperative.
	[See Nishi Ward in Sapporo City, Ishikari sub-prefecture, for 
liquor production.]
	I did not know that sweet potatoes are cultivated in Hokkaidou 
as a commercial crop.  Sweet potatoes are cultivated under a warm 
climate.  Sweet potato seeds are weak in cold.  In my hometown (Ibaraki 
Prefecture), sweet potato seeds were preserved in a deep hole.  The 
depth was about the height of a man.  [By T. Nihei et al. 2000.

LOCATION

Otobe [o-to-be] [\u4E59\u90E8] is a town in Hiyama sub-prefecture, 
south Hokkaidou (``dou-nan'').   Otobe is located in the west of the 
Oshima Peninsula.  The area faces the Sea of Japan.  Forests occupy 87 
percent of the area.

NAME

The name ``Otobe'' comes from ``o-to-un-pe'' in Ainu language. 
It means ``river mouth, swamp, exist, thing (river).''  It signified 
the Hime River, which flows through the center of the town.  In the Edo 
era, the river was called Otohe.  [By Takeshirou Matsuura's map 
published in 1859; http://koukita.github.io/touzaiezo/map/]  #2  

HISTORY

In the Edo era, the area was governed by the Matsumae Domain.  Herring 
fishing thrived.  According to oral tradition, Hanaiso-suwa Shrine was 
established in 1617 (Guen-na 3).  The shrine's name is recorded in a 
document written in 1704.  #3
	After the Meiji period, in 1869 (Meiji 2), the Meiji government 
forces landed at Otobe.  It was during the Boshin War.  (Boshin War was 
a civil war.)  They advanced to Esashi and then to Hakodate.  They 
defeated the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces and ended the war.  #4
 	In 1879 (Meiji 12), the administrative office (``kochou-
yakuba'') of Otobe village was established.  It covered villages of 
Komonai [\u5C0F\u8302\u5185] and Toppu [\u7A81\u7B26].  The 
administrative office of Mitsuya [\u4E09\u30C4\u8C37] village was 
established.  It covered Kabashira [\u868A\u67F1] village.
 	In 1902 (Meiji 35), Otobe Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established by the merger of five villages.  In 1965 (Shouwa 40), Otobe 
Town was established.
	[See the note of Matsumae Town for 2nd-class municipality.]

TOWN HALL, TRAFFIC

The town hall of Otobe is located near the mouth of the Hime River.  
National Route 229 (Hiyama-kokudou) runs along the sea.  The national 
highway connects old settlements that flourished in fishery or 
forestry.  #5

INDUSTRY

Distinctive industries in Otobe are fishery, agriculture, fish 
processing, and forestry.  STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 127 
hectares in 2015, soybeans 89, broccoli 26, adzuki beans 17, fodder 9, 
pasture 4, strawberries 2, orchards 2, radishes 1,
	(continued) --> other vegetables 32+X (including lily bulbs), 
and other grains 20; dairy cows - (zero) in 2015.  STATISTICS OF 
FISHERIES = walleye pollock 286 tons in 2017, squid (flying squid 214, 
other squid 1), sea urchins 39, octopus 32, salmon 13, Pacific cod 5,
	(continued) --> olive flounder 3, Konbu kelp 3, shrimp/prawns 
2, yellowtail 1, right-eye flounder 1, atka mackerel 1, abalone 1, 
herring 0, other fish 17, and other marine animals 16 (including sea 
cucumbers).
	Fishing ports are located in Otobe, Guen-na, and Toyohama.  As 
for other industries, a factory of CAC Cosmetics and Tomioka winery are 
located.  The founder of CAC Cosmetics was born in a pharmacy in Otobe. 
	Tomioka winery was founded in 1976.  A distilling company, 
Sapporo-shusei, acquired Tomioka winery in 2008.  The head office of 
Sapporo-shusei is located in Nishi Ward, Sapporo City, Ishikari sub-
prefecture.
 	As for sightseeing, Guen-na-dai Beach Park has been selected as 
one of the 100 Beaches of Japan.  (The 100 Beaches of Japan is 
designated by the Ministry of the Environment.)  It is the only 100 
Beaches in Hokkaidou island.  The country sign (gateway sign) of Otobe 
depicts the artificial seawater pool at Guen-na-dai Beach Park.
	These are other scenic locations.  (1) Cape Shibi-no-saki, 
which is andesite columnar jointing.  The shape resembles tuna scales.  
The word ``shibi'' means tuna in old Japanese.  (The word ``andesite'' 
is ``anzan-gan'' in Japanese.  The word ``columanr jointing'' is 
``chuujou-setsuri'' in Japanese.)
	(continued) --> (2) Cape Tateno-saki, whose nickname is 
the Grand Canyon of the Orient.  (3) Takise coast, which is known for 
Shira-hura.  Shira-fura is a white coastal cliff.   #6

NOTE
 
#1  The Kanji characters for Nishi-gun (Nishi county) are difficult to 
read even for Japanese people.  In the beginning of the Meiji period, 
the name was decided. 
	Takeshirou Matsuura, who was an explorer of Ezo (now 
Hokkaidou), suggested the name ``Nishi (West)'' for the county.  He 
suggested an easy Kanji character to Nishi [\u897F].  [By Hidezou 
Yamada & Toshikazu Sasaki eds. 1988. ``Ainu-go-chimei-shiryou-syuusei 
(Ainu language place name material collection).''  Soufuu-kan ISBN 
4883230368]
	It was changed to difficult Kanji characters to Nishi [\u723E
\u5FD7], because there were identical names in Honshuu island.

#2  The name ``Otohe'' means ``river mouth, swamp, exist, thing'' in 
Ainu language.  As the name suggests, there were many swamps and ponds 
in the lower reaches of the Otohe River (now Hime River).  They were 
reclaimed and turned into paddy fields and a built-up area.
	The current river name ``Hime'' means ``princess'' or ``noble 
lady'' in Japanese.  It refers to Shizuka-gozen in the case of Otobe 
Town.   Shizuka-gozen was a ``mekake (concubine)'' of Yoshitsune 
Minamoto.
	Yoshitsune Minamoto was a commander of the Minamoto clan in 
the 12th century.  He was killed in battle in Oushuu (now Touhoku 
region), but many legends mention that he fled to Ezo (now Hokkaidou).  
This is one of the Yoshitune legends in Otobe;
	``Shizuka-gozen came Otohe in search of Yoshitune.  She could 
not find him, because he had escaped far inland.  She was disappointed 
and committed suicide by drowning in the river.''  Therefore, the river 
is called the Hime River after Shizuka-gozen.
	I guess that the legend depicts the death of a courtesan 
[kou-ti-zan] in the end of Edo era or in the Meiji Period.  Cf. 
[see-eff]. There is Oiran-buchi in Minami Ward, Sapporo City, Ishikari 
sub-prefecture.  The name ``Oiran-buchi'' means ``Oiran (courtesan), 
abyss.'' Once, a courtesan committed suicide by drowning in the river.
	[See Biratori Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture and Esashi Town in 
Hiyama sub-prefecture for Yoshitsune legend.  See Oshamanbe Town in 
Oshima sub-prefecture for river names.]
 
#3  During the Tenmei period (1781-1789) in the Edo era, Otobe was 
Sengoku-basho of herring.  The word ``sengoku-basho'' means ``a trading 
place that has 1,000-koku catches of herring.''
	The word ``koku'' is an old unit of measurement.  One ``koku'' 
was equivalent to 150 kg of dried herring, or 200 kg of fresh herring. 
	[See Esashi Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for one ``koku'' of 
rice.  See Kuriyama Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for one ``koku'' of 
rice wine.]
 	During the Tenmei Famine [fa'min] (1782-1788) and the Tenpou 
Famine (1833-1839), Japanese people migratede from Nanbu, Hirosaki, and 
Akita to Otobe.  (Nanbu was what is now Iwate and Aomori prefectures, 
Hirosaki was what is now Aomori Prefecture.)
	Otobe Town has districts of Sakaehama, which means ``thriving 
beach'' in Japanese, and Toyohama, which means ``rich beach'' in 
Japanese.  Those names remind us of the good old days.  After 1917 
(Taishou 6), large schools of herring disappeared from Otobe.
	[See Yoichi Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture and Esashi Town 
in Hiyama sub-prefecture for herring fishing.]

#4  In December 1868 (Meiji 1), during the Boshin War, the Tokugawa 
Shogunate forces advanced to the castle town of the Matsumae Domain 
(now Matsumae Town).  It was November of the lunar calendar used at the 
time.
	The Matsumae Domain's forces escaped to Tate Castle in Assabu. 
Tate Castle fell too.  They escaped to Otobe.  The lord of the Matsumae 
Domain escaped to Hirosaki (now Aomori Prefecture), and the rest of the 
Matsumae Domain's forces surrendered.  Villagers in Otobe hid Matsumae 
soldiers by dressing them in farmer's clothes.
	[See Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the Boshin War. 
See Assabu Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the end of the Matsumae 
Domain.]
 
#5  A bus stop ``Otobe-juuji-gai'' is located near the town hall.  The 
name ``juuji-gai'' is Japanese.  It means ``cross, road.''  The word 
``juu-ji'' means ``ten, character.''  The shape of the Kanji character 
for ten (``juu [\u5341]'' is a cross.
	The place name``Juuji-gai'' can be found also in Fukagawa, 
Hakodate, Kushiro, Okushiri, Otaru, Shikaoi, Rumoi, and Yoichi in 
Hokkaidou.
	[See Otaru City in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for Okusawa-juuji-
gai.]
	The Kanji character ``juu'' is mysterious.  It becomes ``10,'' 
``1,'' and ``0.''  For example, ''juu'' means 10, ``juu-go'' means 15, 
and ``ni-juu'' means 20.
	* * *
	In contrast to cross road (``juu-ji-gai''), castle towns in 
Honshuu island have T-junctions (``tei-ji-ro'') and crank-shaped roads 
(``kaguino-te'').  The Kanji character ``tei [\u4E01]'' resembles the 
letter ``T'' in both shape and pronunciation.
	Those complicated roads in castle towns were constructed for 
defensive purposes.  During the period of motorization, those 
complicated roads were obstructs for automobile traffic. Today, some of 
them are used for sightseeing.
	[See Toubetsu Town in Ishikari sub-prefecture for crank-shaped 
road.]
	Motorization in Japan started after the late 1960s.  My father 
bought Nissan Cherry in the 1970s.  The novel ``The Grapes of Wrath'' 
depicts that the motorization in the USA started in the early 20th 
century.

#6  The name ``Guen-na-dai'' in Otobe Town signifies Guen-na period 
(1615-1624) in the Edo era.  A fishing ground was built in the period.  
	Hanaiso-suwa Shrine near the fishing port of Toyohama was 
built in 1617.  Fishing ports in Otobe are very old.
	The tourist site Cape Shibi-no-saki was included in Kabashira 
village.  The fishing port of Toyohama was also included in Kabashira 
village.
	Kabashira is a funny name.  It means ``mosquito pillar'' in 
Japanese.  The name comes from ``kapara-sirar'' in Ainu language.  It 
means ``flat, rock.''  (Once, I saw a large mosquito pillar in a hotel 
room in a tropical region.) 
	As for Shira-fura cliff, I guess that the name comes from 
``sirar-hu-ra'' in Ainu language, which means ``rock, raw, intestine.'' 
The eroded cliff looks like intestines of fish.

LOCATION

Okushiri [o-ku-shi-ri] [\u5965\u5C3B] is a town in Hiyama sub-
prefecture, south Hokkaidou (``dou-nan'').  The area is Okushiri island 
in the Sea of Japan.  Okushiri is the second largest island in 
Hokkaidou after Rishiri.
	The area of Okushiri is about the same size as Lake Saroma. 
Coastal terraces are located to the east, paddy fields to the south, 
and coastal cliffs to the west and north.  Forests cover 86 percent of 
the area.

NAME

The name ``Okushiri'' comes from ``i-kus-un-sir'' in Ainu language.  It 
means ``it, over there, exist, island.''  Or, it comes from ``i-kus-
sir'' in Ainu language.  It means ``it, over there, island.''  Both 
signified Okushiri island, which is located across the sea as seen from 
Kumaishi.

HISTORY

In the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain built Kujiri-basho (a trading 
place) in Okushiri island.  Herring fishing prospered through the Edo 
era to the Meiji period.
	In 1879 (Meiji 12), an administrative office (``kochou-
yakuba'') was built for the villages of Tsurikake [\u91E3\u61F8], 
Akaishi [\u8D64\u77F3], Yakushi [\u85AC\u5E2B], and Aonae [\u9752
\u82D7].
	In 1906 (Meiji 39), Okushiri Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established by the merger of four villages.  In 1966 (Shouwa 41), 
Okushiri Town was established.
	[See the note of Matsumae Town for 2nd-class municipality.]

TOWN HALL, TRAFFIC

The town hall of Okushiri is located in Okushiri district to the east.  
Other built-up areas are located in Aonae district to the south and 
Kamui-waki district (now Yunohama district) to the west.
	Regarding transportation, Heart Land Ferry connects ports of 
Okushiri, Setana, and Esashi.  Okushiri Airport opened in 1974 in Aonae 
district.  Hokkaidou Air System connects Okushiri and Hakodate 
airports. 

INDUSTRY

Distinctive industries in Okushiri are fishing, food processing, and 
sightseeing.  STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = pasture 41 hectares in 2015, 
paddy rice 37, and orchards 31; dairy cows X (concealed) in 2015 and 
beef cattle X.  STATISTICS OF FISHERIES = squid (flying squid 417 tons 
in 2017, other squid 8), sea urchins 111, Pacific cod 69, octopus 59, 
	(continued) --> atka mackerel 58, shellfish 22 (abalone,

seaweed 5, olive flounder 4, yellowtail 1, herring - (zero), other fish 
52, and other marine animals 23.
	As for food processing, local specialties are rice wine 
(``sake'') and wine.  As for sightseeing, Nabetsuru Rock is located 
near the ferry port.  It is the icon of the island, 
	The country sign (gateway sign) of Okuhsiri is a map of the 
island.  It illustrates strange shaped rocks and Bentenguu Shrine.  
Okushiri Tsunami Museum is located in Aonae district.  #1  #2  #3

NOTE

#1  In the past, Okushiri was the island of alcohol prohibition.  
 (Alcohol prohibition is called ``kinshu'' in Japanese.)   When 
the herring catch was poor, fishermen drunk, and quarreled very much.  
So, village chief (``kochou'') banned drinking alcohol.  Prohibition 
lasted from 1885 to 1890.
	Today, rice wine (``sake'') and wine are the specialties of 
Okushiri.  There is an ``Ordinance to promote toasts with Okushiri's 
local rice wine.''  (Japanese people became more polite when they 
drink.) 
	[See Asahikawa City in Kamikawa sub-prefecture for rice wine.  
See Ikeda Town in Tokachi sub-prefecture for wine.]

#2  Okushiri island is located near the boundary between the Eurasian 
Plate and North American Plate.  In July 1993, the Okushiri Earthquake, 
happened and killed 230 people.  The magnitude was 7.8.  The disaster 
was due to tidal waves (``tsunami''), fires, and landslides.
	Being close to the epicenter, the first tidal wave arrived two 
to three minutes after the earthquake.  Tidal waves killed 198 people. 
Soon after the earthquake, television channels broadcast live footage 
from the sky.  In that night, Aonae district was burning.
	In 1998, the town declared ``completion of recovery.'' In 2001, 
Tsunami Museum opened.
	* * *
	The Sanriku Coast in the Touhoku region was hit by tidal waves. 
At an elementary school along the coast, all children could escape from 
the massve tidal waves in 2011.
	 The grandparents taught their children the phrase ``tsunami-
tendenko (tidal wave, alone).''  This means that if a large earthquake 
occurs, you must escape alone as soon as possible.

#3  These are strange shaped rocks in Okushiri island; (1) Nabe-tsuru 
Rock, which resembles a handle of iron pot, (2) Kabuto Rock (warrior's 
helmet rock), (3) Hoya Rock (sea pineapple rock), (4) Mottate Rock 
(erection rock), and (4) Muean-jima (lonely island).
	The shape of Nabe-tsuru Rock was changed by a large earthquake 
in 1993.  It was restored.  There are unique stories with the unique 
rocks.  A remote island exerts a strong fascination over some people.

LOCATION

Setana [se-ta-na] is a town in Hiyama sub-prefecture, south Hokkaidou 
(`dou-nan'').  Setana is located in the west of the Oshima Peninsula.  
The area faces the Sea of Japan.  Cape Obana is the western tip of 
Hokkaidou island.  Ordinary tourists cannot go to the western tip, 
because it is a steep sea cliff.  #1
 	The area of Setana was newly delimited in 2005 by the merger of 
three towns; Taisei [\u5927\u6210], Kita-hiyama [\u5317\u6A9C\u5C71], 
and Setana [\u702C\u68DA] (from south to north).
	The name Taisei means ``big success'' in Japanese.  It was 
named by local residents when Kudou [\u4E45\u9060] Village and 
Kaitorima [\u8C9D\u53D6\u6F97] Villages were merged in 1955.  The name 
Kita-hiyama means ``north Hiyama (cypress mountain)'' in Japanese.
	[See Hiyama sub-prefecture for the name ``Hiyama.'']
	The name ``Setana'' comes from ``seta-rupespe-nay'' in Ainu 
language.  It means ``dog, cross, river.''  It signified a place near 
the Baba River, which flows the center of the old Setana Town.  Large 
rocks stand near the mouth of the river.
	The rocks are Sanbon-sugui-iwa (Three-ceders Rocks) and 
Rousoku-iwa (Candle Rock).  Sanbon-sugui-iwa rocks stand from the sea 
and Rousoku-iwa rock stands at the Port of Setana.  They look like 
dogs.  #2

HISTORY

In the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain established three trading places 
(``basho'') for fishing.  They were located in Kudou, Futoro, and 
Setanai (from south to north).  The places thrived from herring 
fishing.  (Futoro was located at the mouth of the Futoro River that 
flows through the former Kita-hiyama Town.)
	After the Meiji period, three counties were established in 1869 
(Meiji 2).  They were Kudou, Futoro, and Setana.  The following is the 
history of the former three towns;

OLD TAISEI TOWN; In 1872 (Meiji 5), Kudou branch of the Hokkaidou 
Development Commission was established.  In 1880 (Meiji 13), the 
administrative office (``kochou-yakuba'') of Issouma [\u4E00\u8258
\u6F97] village was established.
	The administrative office of Issouma village covered other five 
villages; Oota [\u592A\u7530], Uekotan [\u4E0A\u53E4\u4E39], Sansouma 
[\u4E09\u8258\u6F97], Hikata-tomari [\u65E5\u65B9\u6CCA], and Yunoshiri 
[\u6E6F\u5C3B].
	In the same year, the administrative office of Hiratanai 
[\u5E73\u7530\u5185] was established.  It covered other two villages; 
Kaitorima and Nagaiso [\u9577\u78EF].  In 1881 (Meiji 14), the 
administrative office of Kudou village was established by the merger of 
Issouma, Sansouma, and Hikata-tomari.
	In 1902 (Meiji 35), Kudou Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established by the merger of Kudou, Oota, Uekotan, and Yunoshiri.  In 
1923 (Taishou 12), Kaitorima Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established by the merger of Kaitorima, Hiratanai, and Nagaiso.
	In 1955 (Shouwa 30), Taisei Village was established by the 
merger of Kudou and Kaitorima.  In 1966 (Shouwa 41), Taisei Town was 
established.
	[See the note of Matsumae Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class 
municipalities.] 

OLD KITA-HIYAMA TOWN; In 1879 (Meiji 12), an administrative office 
(``kochou-yakuba'') was established for four villages in Futoro county; 
Futoro [\u592A\u6AD3], Gorota [\u53E4\u6AD3\u591A], Raruishi [\u826F
\u7460\u77F3], and Udomari [\u9D5C\u6CCA].
	In 1902 (Meiji 35), the administrative office of Higashi-setana 
[\u6771\u702C \u68DA] village was established.  It was separated from 
Setana village.
 	In 1906 (Meiji 39), Futoro Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established by the merger of Futoro, Gorota, Raruishi, and Udomari.  In 
the same year, Higashi-setana Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established.
	In 1953 (Shouwa 28), Higashi-setana Town was established.  In 
1955 (Shouwa 30), Kita-hiyama Town was established by the merger of 
Higashi-setana Town and Futoro Village.

OLD SETANA TOWN; In 1879 (Meiji 12), two administrative offices 
(``kochou-yakuba'') were established for five villages in Setana 
county; Setana, Baikatsu [\u6885\u82B1\u90FD], Nakauta [\u4E2D\u6B4C], 
Abura [\u867B\u7F85], and Shimauta [\u5CF6\u6B4C].
	In 1897 (Meiji 30), Toshibetsu village was separated from 
Setana village.  It was what is now Imakane Town, Hiyama sub-
prefecture.
	In 1902 (Meiji 35), Setana Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established by the merger of five villages in Setana county.  Higashi-
setana village was separated from Setana Village.  (This means that an 
administrative office was built in Higashi-setana village).
	In 1919 (Taishou 8), Setana Village (1st-class municipality) 
was established.  In 1921 (Taishou 10), Setana Town was established.

TOWN HALL, TRAFFIC

The town hall of Setana is located near the mouth of the Toshibetsu 
River (Shiribeshi-toshibetsu River).  It used to be the town hall of 
Kita-hiyama Town.  National Route 229 (Hiyama-kokudou) runs along the 
Sea of Japan.  #3
	National Route 230 (Pirika-kokudou) separates from National 
Route 229 near the town hall.  National Route 230 crosses the Oshima 
Peninsula.  Formerly, the Setana Line of the Japanese National 
Railways (Kokutetsu) ran along National Route 230.  The railway 
connected Setana Station and Kun-nui Station in Oshamanbe Town.
	The Port of Setana has a ferry line to Okushiri island.  The 
windmills near the port are the first offshore windmills in the 
country.  In the built-up area of the former Setana Town, there was a 
clinic run by Guinko Oguino.  She was the first female medical doctor 
in the country.  #4

INDUSTRY

Distinctive industries in Setana are fishing, paddy rice cultivation, 
and dairy farming.  STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = pasture 2,046 hectares 
in 2015, paddy rice 1,537, beans (soybeans 353, adzuki beans 84, other 
beans 7), fodder 268, potatoes 153, buckwheat 146, sugar beets 64, 
wheat 48, broccoli 23, spinach 10, orchards 5, 
	(continued) --> radishes 3, melons 1, other vegetables 46+X 
(sweet corn, pumpkins, asparagus), and other grains 11; dairy cows 
2,886 head in 2015.  STATISTICS OF FISHERIES = squid (flying squid 618 
tons in 2017, other squid 3), salmon 283, sea urchins 133, octopus 65, 
Pacific cod 46, seaweed (Konbu kelp 26, other seaweed 5), 
	(continued) --> olive flounder 22, atka mackerel 19, right-eye 
flounder 17, yellowtail 16, shellfish (abalone 2, other shellfish 10 
[oysters]), shrimp/prawns 9, sharks 4, puffer fish 2, herring 0, other 
fish 92, and other marine animals 16.
	Local specialties include the rice wine (``sake'') that is made 
from locally grown rice.  #5
 
NOTE 

#1  Among the northern tip, southern tip, eastern tip, and western tip 
of Hokkaidou island, the western tip is the most difficult to visit.  
It is a steep cliff at Cape Obana.
	Including small islands, the western tip is Oshima-ooshima 
island in Matsumae Town, Oshima sub-prefecture.  It is an uninhabited 
island. 
	Oota Shrine at Cape Obana is one of the oldest shrines in 
Hokkaidou.  It was established around 1441.  It is one of the most 
difficult shrines to visit.
	It is located at the top of a rocky mountain.  Bears live. 
Visitors are like climbers.  They will pray for a safety descent at the 
shrine.  In the past, mountaineering was a religious training.

#2  On the map published by Takeshirou Matsuura in 1859, Haha-gawa (now 
Baba River) and Setaruheshi-nai are written together (http://
koukita.github.io/touzaiezo/map/).
	Tadashi Okudaira wrote that the upper course of the Baba River 
was called the Setanai River.  The Sanbon-sugui-iwa rocks, which 
Ainu people saw as dogs (``seta''), are located at the mouth of the 
Baba River.  [By World Encyclopedia (T. Okudaira et al. 2007.)]
	I asked the town hall where the Setani River was.  They 
answered that the Setanai River would signify what is now the 
Toshibetsu River (Shiribeshi-toshibetsu River).  They showed a map of 
Setanai Basho (Setanai trading place) as evidence.  The map was drawn 
in the Ansei period (1855-1860) in the Edo era.
	Hiyama and Oshima sub-prefectures have a long history of 
Japanese settlement.  Some river names and place names were changed 
from Ainu language to Japanese.  These are examples;
	(1) The Baba River in Setana Town, whose old name may have been 
the Setanai River.  (2) The Hime River in Otobe Town, whose old name 
was the Otohe River.  (3) The Torizaki River in Mori Town, whose old 
name was the Oniushi River.
	[See Oshamanbe Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for typical river 
names in Ainu language.]
	As for the name ``Seta-nai'' (``dog, river'' in Ainu language), 
there is an Ainu legend; ``Once upon a time, large dogs came down from 
the mountains.  They were messengers of god.  They went into the sea 
and turned into rocks.''
	During a bus excursion, a student heard this topic from an 
elderly man who was walking National Route 229; ``During the Okushiri 
Earthquake, tidal waves (``tsunami'') surrounded Sanbon-sugui Rocks and 
reached this highway.  After the water subsided, sea urchins and 
flounders were left on this highway.''
	[See Okushiri Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the Okushiri 
Earthquake.]
 
#3  National Route 229 runs along the coast.  It runs inland 
near Cape Obana.  Cape Obana is the western tip of Hokkaidou island.
It is located at the border between the former Taisei Town and the 
former Kita-hiayama Town.  
	There are strangely shaped rocks along the coast; Mother Bear 
and Cub Rock, Mammoth Rock, and Raccoon Rock.
 
#4  Guinko Oguino (1851-1913) was born in Tawarase village (now 
Kumagaya City, Saitama Prefecture).  In 1885, she passed medical 
practitioner's examination and opened a clinic for gynecology and 
obstetrics.  She became the first female medical doctor in the country. 
He clinic was located in Yushima, Tokyo.
	In 1891, her husband, Yukiyoshi Shikata, started developing 
Immanuel district.  Immanuel was located what is now Imakane Town, 
Hiyama sub-prefecture.  Immanuel was developed by Christians.  It was 
located upstream of the Shiribeshi-toshibetsu River. 
	[See Imakane Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the name 
``Immanuel.'']
	In 1894, Guinko Oguino moved to Immanuel.  Her husband failed 
in development and became a missionary.  In 1897, she moved to Setana 
Setana and opened a clinic.  (Setana is located near the mouth of the 
Shiribeshi-toshibetsu River.)
	In 1903, she went to Sapporo.  She wanted to open a larger 
clinic in Sapporo, however, she was told that her medical technique was 
20 years' behind.  She returned to Setana.  In 1905, her husband died. 
In 1908, she returned to Tokyo.
	* * *
	As for a medical doctor, I lived in a teachers' apartment in 
Sapporo City.  Next to the apartment was a clinic for internal medicine 
and pediatrics.  The elderly doctor said; ``I was originally internist. 
When I added pediatrics in this clinic, my friends scorned me.  But I 
had to raise my children.''
	He was proud that his three sons became medical doctors.  When 
I went to the clinic with the influenza, he said; ``The latest machine 
to test the influenza is expensive.  The debt remains with my son, 
ha, ha, ha (laugh).''
	After his sudden death, one of his sons came from a hospital 
and succeeded the clinic for about a year.  Then, the clinic was 
demolished and an apartment was built.

#5  A graduation thesis submitted to Faculty of Letters, Hokkaidou 
University, was on the theme of rice wine production in Setana Town. 
The following is an excerpt from it. 
	``The producers of the rice wine are farmers.  They cultivate 
paddy rice and brew rice wine.  They sell two trade names of sake. 
One is Guinko-monogatari (Guinko's story) and the other is Yoshiko.
	Guinko-monogatari is made from the brewery rice variety 
``Guinpuu.''  It is cultivated by rice-duck farming.  (Rice-duck 
farming is a kind of organic agriculture.)  Yoshiko is made from 
the ordinal rice variety ``Kirara 397.''
	The producers of the rice wine wanted to use the names Kita-
hiyama and Suisen.  The name ``Kita-hiyama'' is the former town's 
name.  The word ``suisen'' means daffodil in Japanese.  It is the 
town's flower.  Those names had been already trademarked.
	 For the rocal rice wine, the name ``Guinko'' was selected 
because she was a famous female doctor in Setana.  The name ``Yoshiko''
was selected because it is a common name in the town, such as the wife 
and mother of the rice wine producers.
	The cultivation of brewery rice is difficult in Hokkaidou.  The 
grain of brewery rice is larger than that of ordinary rice.  (The rice 
wine category `guinjou'' is made using the core of brewery rice.)  The 
rice wine producers in Setana also use the ordinary rice variety 
(Kirara 397). 
	[See Uryuu Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture and Pippu Town in 
Kamikawa sub-prefecture for Kirara 397.]
	* * *
	Hokkaidou's wine is also made from ordinary grapes, such 
as Naiagara.  (``Ordinary grapes'' means table grapes in Japan.)  Also, 
locally grown mountain grapes (Yama-budou) are used.
	As for the brewery rice variety, Yamada-nishiki is the most 
famous.  It has been used for the rice wine made in the Nada region 
(now Hyougo Prefecture, in the central part of Honshuu island).  Nada 
is famous for rice wine production.
	The Nada's rice wine was shipped to Ezo (now Hokkaidou) by 
North-bound ships.  It is said that the rice wine transported by ship 
tastes better.
	[See Asahikawa City in Kamikawa sub-prefecture, Mashike Town in 
Rumoi sub-prefecture, and Kuriyama Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for 
rice wine.  See Ikeda Town in Tokachi sub-prefecture for wine.]

LOCATION

Imakane [i-ma-ka-ne] [\u4ECA\u91D1] is a town in Hiyama sub-prefecture, 
south Hokkaidou (``dou-nan'').  Imakane is located inland in the Oshima 
Peninsula.  The area corresponds to the midstream and upstream of the 
Shiribeshi-toshibetsu River, which flows to the Sea of Japan.  Local 
residents call it Toshibetsu River.  Its downstream is Setana Town.

NAME

The name ``Imakane'' is Japanese.  It is derived from two pioneers, 
Toujirou Imamura and Ishirou Kanamori (Ima- and Kane-).  Both pioneers 
were graduates of Tokyo Professional School (now Waseda University).  
#1

HISTORY

In the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain gathered gold dust in the upstream 
of the Shiribetsu-toshibetsu River.  In the Meiji period, there were 
agate and manganese mines.
	In 1893 (Meiji 26), the two pioneers settled in what is now 
Imakane district. In the same year, a group of Christians (Kirisuto-
kyou-dantai) settled in Immanuel district.  #2
	In 1897 (Meiji 30), the administrative office (``kochou-
yakuba'') of Toshibetsu [\u5229\u5225] village was established.  The 
village was separated from Setana village.
	In 1906 (Meiji 39), Toshibetsu Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established.  In 1929 (Shouwa 4), Toshibetsu Village (1st-class 
municipality) was established.  In 1947 (Shouwa 22), Imakane Town was 
established.  At the time, Toshibetsu was renamed to Imakane.
	[See the note of Matsumae Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class 
municipalities.] 

TOWN HALL, TRAFFIC

The town hall of Imakane is located along the middle reaches of the 
Shiribeshi-toshibetsu River.  National Route 230 (Pirika-kokudou or 
Hanaishi-douro) runs.  #3  #4
	In the past, the Setana Line ran along the Shiribeshi-
toshibetsu River.  The railway crossed the Oshima peninsula.  It 
connected Setana Station on the Sea of Japan side and Kun-nui Station 
along Uchiura Bay on the Pacific Ocean side.
	(Setana Station was located in the former Setana Town.  Kun-nui 
Station on the Hakodate Main Line is located in Oshamanbe Town).

INDUSTRY

Distinctive industries in Imakane are agriculture, animal husbandry, 
and forestry. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = pasture 1,446 hectares in 
2015, paddy rice 1,414, beans (soybeans 376, adzuki beans 208), 
potatoes 396, wheat 273, fodder 229, sugar beets 117, buckwheat 69,
	(continued) --> carrots 32, broccoli 24, barley 19, tomatoes 
13, onions 5, and other grains 24; dairy cows 2,021 head in 2015 and 
hogs and pigs X (concealed).
 	Potatoes are sold with the trade-name ``Imakane-danshaku.''  As 
for animal husbandry, swine farms of Nippon Ham Group are distributed 
in the mountains.  #5
	As for sightseeing, Pirika Dam is located near Pirika Pass. 
The dam has a long concrete dyke.  It stands out along National Route 
230.  The country sign (gateway sign) of the town is Piiri and Piika, 
which are nicknames for sea cow fossils excavated from the dam 
construction site.  #6

NOTE
 
#1  As for the name ``Imakane,'' the name of the post office is Imagane 
(not Imakane).  The name of the former railroad station was Imagane. 
The name on the topographical map by Geographical Survey Institute is 
Imakane.
	Imakane Town's former name was Toshibetsu.  It comes from 
``tus-pet'' in Ainu language.  It means ``snake (or rope), river.''  
Or, it comes from ``to-us-pet'' in Ainu language.  It means ``pond, 
many, river.''  Both signified the Shiribeshi-toshibetsu River. 
	The Shiribeshi-toshibetsu River was ranked as the cleanest 
river of the country.  The clean river ranking is listed in Current 
Water Quality of Class-A Rivers in the Country (Zenkoku-ikkyuu-kasen-
no-suishitsu-genkyou), which is published by the Ministry of Land, 
Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.
	[See Rankoshi Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for the 
cleanest rivers.] 

#2  The Christian group settled in Immanuel tried to make their utopia. 
The name ``Immanuel'' means ``God with us'' in Hebrew.  It was located 
in what is now Kamioka district.  The name ``Kamioka'' means ``god 
hill'' in Japanese.
	The first female doctor in the country, Guinko Oguino, came to 
Immanuel.  Her husband was a member of the Christian group.
	[See Setana Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for her clinic.]
	On the map published by Takeshiro Matsuura in 1859 (http://
koukita.github.io/touzaiezo/map/), there is a place name written as 
Imanpetsu.  It may come from ``i-ma-un-pet'' in Ainu language, which 
means ``it, burn (skewers for grilled fish), exist, river.''  Maybe, 
the Christian group imagined Immanuel from the pronunciation.
	(Updated in 2024; The place name on the map may be Imashipetsu. 
It may come from ``i-ma-si-pet'' in Ainu language, which means ``it, 
burn, large, river.''  Some Katakana characters are difficult to 
distinguish such as ``n'' and ''shi,'' and ``shi'' and ``tsu.'')

#3  Hanaishi district is located near Pirika Dam.  The word 
``hanaishi'' is Japanese.  It means ``menou'' in Japanese and 
``agate [a'get]'' in English.  Hanaishi was the largest agate mine in 
the country in the Meiji period.  The agate was shipped to Fukui 
Prefecture and carved into ornaments (Wakasa-menou-zaiku). 
	* * *
	Nowadays, agate is mainly imported from Brazil.  When I visited 
Sao Paulo, I entered a souvenir shop.  A Japanese man who also was 
looking souvenirs recommended me to buy agate chopstick rests.
	While pointing to various colored chopstick rests, he said, 
``Agate is artificially colored, but this is natural.''  It was brown. 
He was the president of a construction company and knew many things 
including good restaurants in Sao Paulo.

#4  Near the center of Imakane Town, a large loop bridge stands out. 
It continues up to Hikaridai district, which is an agricultural area 
on a hill.  The loop bridge looks like an expressway, but it is the 
agricultural road called ``Nou-men-douro.''
	The agricultural road (Nou-men-douro) is constructed using 
gasoline tax.  It is considered as a deduction of the gasoline tax that 
was used for agricultural machinery. 
	Other loop bridges in Hokkaidou can be seen in Sunagawa (Sorach 
sub-prefecture), Toyoura (Iburi sub-prefecture), and Asari district in 
Otaru (Shiribeshi sub-prefecture).

#5  ``Danshaku'' is a potato cultivar for eat.  The word ``danshaku''
means ``baron'' in Japanese.  Danshaku potatoes are as pouplar as May-
queen potatoes.  (The major potato cultivar for processing is Kona-
fubuki.)
	Imakane potatoes have a reputation for quality.  The potato 
cultivated area in Imakane is smaller than that of municipalities in 
Tokachi sub-prefecture.  The land per farm in Imakane is also smaller 
than that of municipalities in Tokachi sub-prefecture.  (Tokachi is 
famous for potato production.)
	Farmers in Imakane take time on their smaller land.  In the 
case of potato cultivation, they remove ``nora-imo (stray potatoes),'' 
which are the rest of the former harvest.  The so-called stray potatoes 
give a bad impact on the next cultivation.
	A former high school teacher said; ``Potatoes are cultivated 
after potatoes in south Hokkaidou (`dou-nan,' including Imakane Town). 
Potatoes are cultivated in crop rotation in east Hokkaidou (`dou-tou,' 
including Tokachi sub-prefecture).''
	In Tokachi, potatoes are cultivated after sugar beets.  Then, 
beans or wheat are cultivated after potatoes.  The so-called stray 
potatoes are killed by the cold temperature.  However, recently, not 
all stray potatoes are killed because of climate change.
	[See Shihoro Town in Tokachi sub-prefecture for potatoes.  See 
Kucchan Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for Danshaku potatoes.  See 
Assabu Town for May-queen potatoes.]
 
#6  The width of Pirika Dam is 1,480 meters.  It is the longest 
concrete dam in the country.
	The dam was constructed between 1975 and 1991 at the confluence 
of the three rivers; the Shiribeshi-toshibetsu River, the Pirikabetsu
River, and the Chuushibetsu River.
	Pirika Dam is used for power generation, irrigation, and flood 
control.  The driftwood collected from the dam lake is distributed free 
of charge for personal use, such as for wood-burning stoves and 
gardening.
	Kur [ku-a] Plaza Pirika is located in front of the dam.  It 
includes a hot spring, a ski resort, and a restaurant.  The specialty 
of the restaurant is dam curry.  Rice is blocking the curry like a dam.
	[See Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for curry and 
rice.]
	In the upstream of the Pirikabetsu River, there is Okupirika 
hot spring.  It is located along Prefectural Route 999.  The name 
``Pirika-betsu'' means ``beautiful river'' in Ainu language.  The Kanji 
characters for Pirika [\u7F8E\u5229\u6CB3] also means ``beautiful, 
gain, river.''
