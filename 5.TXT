When I worked for Hokkaidou University from 2010 to 2021, I guided many 
excursions. This file is made based on my excursion notes at the time. 
(by T. Nihei)
	Place names are written as they are pronounced, for example, 
Hokkaido --> Hokkaidou. This is because the file is for oral 
explanations (Nihei lab 2025). #1 #2

	I would like to dedicate this work to Baron Kondou (Kijuurou 
Kondou) who died in 2023. He studied equitation science in England and 
thoroughbred breeding in our laboratory. He told us interesting stories 
about the old life in Sapporo.

 -----------------
Oshima [o-shi-ma] [\u6E21\u5CF6] is a sub-prefecture (sougou-shinkou-
kyoku) in south Hokkaidou (dou-nan). It is located in the south the 
Oshima Peninsula. It faces Uchiura Bay (Volcano Bay), Tsugaru Strait, 
and the Sea of Japan. #1
	Compared to other areas in Hokkaidou, the temperature is high. 
By Koeppen's climate classification, the coast of Matsumae Town is 
classified as Cfa (humid subtropical), whereas most areas in Hokkaidou 
is classified as Dfb (humid continental, cool summer).
	In the case of Hakodate City, the mean annual temperature is 
9.1 degrees Celsius (average from 1981 to 2010), the mean annual 
precipitation is 1,152 millimeters, and the mean annual snowfall is 381 
centimeters. #2
	The name ``Oshima'' is Japanese. The pronunciation of the Kanji 
characters ``Watari-shima'' [\u6E21\u5CF6] changed to Oshima. The name 
means ``across, island.''
	In the mid 15th century, forts (Tate) were established by 
Japanese people. In the Edo era (17th to 19th centuries), the area was 
ruled by the Matsumae Domain and sometimes by the Tokugawa Shogunate. 
(See Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the forts; See 
Matsumae Town and Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the 
history of the Edo era).
	After the Meiji period, in 1869 (Meiji 2), Oshima country 
(Oshima-no-kuni [\u6E21\u5CF6\u56FD]) was established. The Hokkaidou 
Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi) was established in Hakodate. In 
1871 (Meiji 4), the Hokkaidou Development Commission moved to Sapporo. 
Hakodate became a branch.
	In 1879 (Meiji 12), administrative offices for counties (gun-
yakusho [\u90E1\u5F79\u6240]) were established. Administrative offices 
for villages and towns (kochou-yakuba) were established. 
(Administrative offices before this year were a continuation of 
village chief [kochou] and town chief [kochou] from the Edo era).
	In 1882 (Meiji 15), the Hokkaidou Development Commission was 
abolished. Prefectures of Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro were 
established. In 1886 (Meiji 19), the three prefectures were abolished. 
Hokkaidou Prefecture Office (Hokkaidou-chou) was established.
	In 1897 (Meiji 30), administrative offices for counties were 
abolished. In the area what is now Oshihma, three sub-prefectures
(shichou [\u652F\u5E81]) were established. They were Hakodate, Kameda, 
and Matsumae.
	In 1899 (Meiji 32), Hakodate sub-prefecture merged Kameda sub-
prefecture. In 1903 (Meiji 36), Hakodate sub-prefecture merged Matsumae 
sub-prefecture. Thus, municipalities were renovated drastically in the 
Meiji period.
	In 1922 (Taishou 11), Hakodate sub-prefecture was renamed 
Oshima sub-prefecture. In 2010, Oshima General Sub-prefecture Bureau 
(Oshima-sougou-shinkou-kyoku) was established.
	These are municipalities in Oshima sub-prefecture; (1) Hakodate 
City 279,127 (population in 2010, third largest in Hokkaidou), (2) 
Hokuto City 48,032, (3) Nanae Town 28,453, (4) Yakumo Town 18,896, (5) 
Mori Town 17,859, (6) Matsumae Town 8,748, (7) Oshamanbe Town 6,386, 
	(continued) --> (8) Kikonai Town 5,386, (9) Fukushima Town 
5,114, (10) Shiriuchi Town 5,074, and (11) Shikabe Town 4,767. The sub-
prefecture bureau is located in Hakodate City.
 
#1  Volcano Bay is called Funka-wan in Japanese. The name ``Volcano 
Bay'' was named in 1796 by William Robert Broughton, a British naval 
officer. At the time, volcanoes erupted around the bay.
	The shape of Volcano Bay looks like a caldera (volcano), 
however, there is no caldera as large as this size in the country. 
(Some students asked me if the bay was a caldera.)
	The largest caldera in the country is Kussharo Caldera in 
Teshikaga Town in Kushiro sub-prefecture, Hokkaidou. When I was in 
elementary school, I heard that Aso Caldera in Kumamoto Prefecture was 
the largest in the world. Today, the world largest caldera is located 
in Indonesia.

#2  In the case of Tokyo (Chiyoda Ward, the representative data of 
Japan), the mean annual temperature is 15.4 degrees Celsius (average 
from 1981 to 2010) and the mean annual rainfall is 1,529 millimeters. 
The climate of Tokyo is classified as Cfa (humid subtropical) by 
Koeppen's climate classification.
	As for the coldest month, the mean temperature of Tokyo is 5.2 
degrees Celsius in January. The mean temperature of Hakodate is -2.6 
degrees Celsius in January. As for the hottest month, the mean 
temperature of Tokyo is 26.4 degrees Celsius in August. The mean 
temperature of Hakodate is 22.0 degrees Celsius in August.
	In Hokkadou, it gets cold after Obon (15th August). In Tokyo, 
it finally gets cooler after the equinox (23rd September).

 ----------------- 
Hiyama [hi-ya-ma] [\u6A9C\u5C71] is a sub-prefecture (shinkou-kyoku) in 
south Hokkaidou (dou-nan). The area stretches in the west of the Oshima 
Peninsula. It faces the Sea of Japan. It is divided into north and 
south. #1
	The climate of Hiyama is mild compared to other areas in 
Hokkaidou. The warm Tsushima Current in the Sea of Japan influences the 
climate. However, it is windy in winter due to the monsoon blowing 
from the continent.
	According to Koeppen's climate classification, most areas of 
Hiyama are classified as Dfb (humid continental, cool summer). The 
coast of Esashi Town and the coast of Okushiri island are classified 
as Cfa (humid subtropical). The other coasts are classified as Cfb 
(temperate oceanic). The population is stuck along the coast.
	In the case of Esashi Town, the mean annual temperature is 10.1 
degrees Celsius (average from 1981 to 2010), the mean annual 
precipitation is 1,197 millimeters, and the mean snowfall is 330 
centimeters. #2
	The name ``Hiyama'' is Japanese. ``Hi-yama'' means ``cypress 
[sai-pres], mountain.'' It was suggested by Takeshirou Matsuura in the 
beginning of the Meiji period. Takeshirou Matsuura was an explorer of 
Hokkaidou. #3
	There used to be natural forests of Hiba (kind of cypress) in 
Hiyama. During the Ed era, after the late 17th century, the Matsumae 
Domain felled cypress trees in the area what is now Hiyama sub-
prefecture. #4
	Japanese immigration to Hiyama has a long history. In the mid 
15th century, the Andou clan built 12 forts in what is now Hiayama and 
Oshima sub-prefectures. In the Edo era, the south part of 
Hiyama was ruled by the Matsumae Domain (for a time ruled by the 
Tokugawa Shogunate.) #5
	After the Meiji period, in 1869 (Meiji 2), the area was 
included in Oshima-no-kuni (Oshima country [\u6E21\u5CF6\u56FD]) and 
Shiribeshi-no-kuni (Shiribeshi country [\u5F8C\u5FD7\u56FD]). In 1872 
(Meiji 5), Esashi office of the Hokkaidou Development Commission was 
built.
	In 1897 (Meiji 30), Hiyama sub-prefecture (Hiyama-shichou 
[\u6A9C\u5C71 \u652F\u5E81] was established. In 2010, Hiyama Sub-
prefecture Bureau (Hiyama-shinkou-kyoku) was established.
	These are municipalities in Hiyama; (1) Setana Town 9,590 
(population in 2010), (2) Esashi Town 9,004, (3) Imakane Town 6,186, 
(4) Kaminokuni Town 5,428, (5) Assabu Town 4,409, (6) Otobe Town 4,408, 
and (7) Okushiri Town 3,033. The sub-prefecture bureau is located in 
Esashi Town.
	The poplation of Hiyama is the smallest of all the sub-
prefectures. All municipalities in Hiyama are designated as depopulated 
areas (Kaso-chiiki).
 
#1  Hiyama sub-prefecture is devided into two parts. There was Kumaishi 
Town in the middle part. Kumaishi was merged to Yakumo Town in Oshima 
sub-prefecture at Pacific Ocean side. There were many reasons for the 
merger across sub-prefectures.

#2  In the case of Tokyo (Chiyoda Ward; the representative data of 
Japan), the mean annual temperature is 15.4 degrees Celsius (average 
from 1981 to 2010) and the mean annual rainfall is 1,529 millimeters. 
The climate of Tokyo is classified as Cfa (humid subtropical).
	As for the coldest month, the mean temperature of Tokyo is 5.2 
degrees Celsius in January. The mean temperature of Esashi is -0.8 
degrees Celsius in January. As for the hottest month, the mean 
temperature of Tokyo is 26.4 degrees Celsius in August. The mean 
temperature of Esashi is 22.6 degrees Celsius in August.
 
#3  Takeshirou Matsuura was an explorer of Ezo (old Hokkaidou) in the 
Edo era. He documented many place names of Ezo island in his book 
``Ezochi-gunmei-no-gi-torishirabe-sho (Ezo region county name survey 
report) [\u8766\u5937\u5730\u90E1\u540D\u4E4B\u5100\u53D6\u8ABF
\u66F8].''
	The book was submitted to the Meiji government in 1869 (Meiji 
2) and government officials decided the place names. ``Hiyama'' was one 
of them.
	Before the Edo era, in the 15th century, the Andou clan 
migrated to Ezo and built 12 forts. They returned to the main land, 
which was located in what is now Touhoku region. The Andou clan built 
Hiyama Castle , which was located in what is now Akita Prefecture.
	As for the name ``Hiyama,'' Takeshirou Matsuura may have 
adopted the old castle built by the Andou clan. (See Kaminokuni Town in 
Hiyama sub-prefecture for the 12 forts.)

#4  As for the name ``Hiyama,'' it means ``cypress mountain'' in 
Japanese. Cypresses usually means ``Hinoki'' in Japanese. However, the 
cypress trees in south Hokkaidou and Aomori prefectures are ``Hiba 
(Hinoki-asunaro).''
	Houryuuji Temple is the oldest wooden building in the country, 
which was rebuilt in 670. The temple is made of Hinoki. Temple 
carpenters (miya-daiku) consider Hinoki is the best wood for 
construction (Nihei lab 2024a). (See Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-
prefecture for the oldest building in Hokkaidou.)
	The another name of Hiba is Hinoki-asunaro. It means 
``tomorrow, it will be Hinoki'' in Japanese. This means that the wood 
of Hiba is inferior to Hinoki. However, the wood of Hiba is also good.
	The leaves of Hiba are denser than Hinoki. Hiba grows slower 
than Hinoki, Sugui (ceder), and Todo-matsu (fir). Hiba grows even on 
shady north slopes and moist soils along the coast. It grows slowy and 
steadily.
	The wood of Hiba has a tight grain and is resistant to 
moisture. The wood is less likely to warp and less likely to rot. It 
was used for pillars, bathtubs, boats, bridges, and cutting boards.
	The natural forests of Hiba in Hiyama sub-prefecture were said 
``very good trees from the coast,'' however, most of them were lost 
for felling and fires in the Edo era.
	Nowadays, two natural forests are preserved in the remote 
mountains. They have been designated as National Natural Monuments. 
(See Assabu Town and Esashi Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for cypress 
felling and the preserved forests.)
 
#5  As for the history of Hiyama sub-prefecture, Masao Kanamori, a 
high school teacher, said; ``Hiyama's culture is different from other 
parts of Hokkaidou. You will see it when you vist festivals.''

1981-2010), PRECIPI 1,263 MM; COUNTRY SIGN = CASTLE.
 
Matsumae [ma-tsu-ma-e] [\u677E\u524D] is a town in Oshima sub-
prefecture, south Hokkaidou (dou-nan). The area is located in the 
southwest of the Oshima Peninsula. The part is also called Matsumae 
Peninsula.
	Matsumae is the southernmost municipality in Hokkaidou. The 
area faces the Tsugaru Strait and the Sea of Japan. It includes islands 
of Ooshima and Kojima on the Sea of Japan. #1 #2
	The area is mountainous. Forests occupy 87 percent. Rivers 
are short. Mt. Daisenguen (1,072 meters) stands to the north. In the 
past, there was a gold mine in Mt. Daisenguen. (See Fukushima Town in 
Oshima sub-prefecture for the gold miners.) 
	The climate along the coast is humid subtropical. It is 
classified as ``Cfa'' by Koeppen's climate classification. Camellia and 
Mousou-dake bamboo grow in Matsumae. (Mousou-dake is a large bamboo. 
Almost all other parts of Hokkaidou are classified as Dfb, humid 
continental and cool summer.)
	The name ``Matsumae'' comes from ``mat-oma-i'' in Ainu 
language. It means ``woman, live, place.'' It signified the uniqueness 
of the place where Japanese women lived. The origin of the place name 
is similar to Kuromatsunai Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture.
	In Ezo (old Hokkaidou), most Japanese people returned to their 
homelands in winter. The name ``Matsumae'' signified that the place was 
the territory of Japanese people. They could give birth (procreate) in 
the place.
	As for history, in 720, the place name Watari-shima-tsugaru-tsu 
[\u6E21\u5CF6\u6D25\u8EFD\u6D25] was recorded. It meant a port (tsu 
[\u6D25]) between Watari-shima (now Hokkaidou Prefecture) and Tsugaru 
(now Aomori Prefecture). It signified the current Port of Matsumae.
	In the 14th century, the place name Matouma-inu [\u4E07\u5802
\u5B87\u6E80\u4F0A\u72AC] was recorded. From the 13th to 15th 
centuries, the Andou clan from Tsugaru traded with Ainu people. In 
1457, Koshamain's War happened.
	 Koshamain was a chief of Ainu people. During the war, the Ainu 
forces destroyed 10 out of the 12 forts, which were built by the Andou 
clan in what is now south Hokkaidou. (See Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama 
sub-prefecture for the old 12 forts and Koshamain's War). #3
	During the Edo era, Matsumae was the capital of the Matsumae 
Domain. It was the northernmost castle town in Japan. The domain 
managed major ports in Ezo (old Hokkaidou), namely, Matsumae, Esashi, 
and Hakodate. Those were gateways to Ezo. ``Matsmai'' in Moby Dick (a 
novel) means Hokkaidou.
	In the end of the Edo era, in 1868, the Matsumae Domain 
separated from the Tokugawa Shogunate and supported the new Meiji 
government. In the beginning of the Meiji period, during the Boshin 
War, the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces landed Ezo and took Fukuyama 
Castle. (Another name of Fukuyama Castle is Matsumae Castle.)
	In 1869 (Meiji 2), the Meiji government forces recaptured 
Fukuyama Castle and advanced to Hakodate, where the former Tokugawa 
Shogunate forces stayed, and ended the Boshin War.
	After the war, the Matsumae Domain was renamed the Tate Domain. 
It was named after Tate Castle in Assabu. (See Hakodate City in Oshima 
sub-prefecture for Boshin War; See Assabu Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture 
for Tate Castle).
	In 1871 (Meiji 4), the Tate Domain was abolished and Aomori 
Prefecture governed the southern part of Hokkaidou. In 1872 (Meiji 5), 
Matsumae office of the Hokkaidoou Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi) 
was established.
	In 1881 (Meiji 14), the administrative office of Matsumae 
county (Matsumae gun-yakusho) was established. Matsumae office of the 
Hokkaidou Development Commission was abolished. In 1897 (Meiji 30), 
Matsumae sub-prefecture was established. The administrative office of 
Matsumae county was abolished.
	In 1900 (Meiji 33), Fukuyama [\u798F\u5C71] Town (1st-class 
municipality) was established. At the time, 34 towns in the built-up 
area of Matsumae were merged. The areas of those towns were small. They 
had existed since the Edo era. #4
	In 1903 (Meiji 36), Hakodate sub-prefecture merged Matsumae 
sub-prefecture. In 1915 (Taishou 4), Ooshima [\u5927\u5CF6] Village 
(2nd-class municipality) was established by the merger of three 
villages; Eramachi [\u6C5F\u826F\u753A], Haraguchi [\u539F\u53E3], and 
Kiyobe [\u6E05\u90E8]. (Ooshima village was not located in Ooshima 
island.)
	In 1923 (Taishou 12), Kojima [\u5C0F\u5CF6] Village (2nd-class 
municipality) was established by the merger of five villages; Nebuta 
[\u6839\u90E8\u7530], Akagami [\u8D64\u795E], Satsumae [\u672D\u524D], 
Mogusa [\u8302\u8349], and Utari [\u96E8\u5782]. (Kojima village was 
not located in in Kojima island.)
	In the same year, Oosawa [\u5927\u6CA2] Village (2nd-class 
municipality) was established by the merger of four villages; Oosawa, 
Araya [\u8352\u8C37], Sumiyaki-zawa [\u70AD\u713C\u6CA2], and Kami-
oyobe [\u4E0A\u53CA\u90E8]. #5
	In 1940 (Shouwa 15), the name Fukuyama was changed to Matsumae. 
In 1954 (Shouwa 29), Matsumae Town merged the villages of Ooshima, 
Kojima, and Oosawa.
	The town hall of Matsumae and Matsumae Castle (Fukuyama Castle) 
are located near the mouth of the Oomatsumae River. National Route 228 
(Fukuyama-kaidou or Matsumae-kokudou) passes there. ``Fukuyama-kaidou'' 
signifies an old trail that connected Matsumae and Hakodate in the Edo 
era. (See Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for Fukuyama-kaidou.) 
#6
	In the past, the Matsumae Line run. Matsumae Station was the 
terminal. The railroad connected Matsumae Town and Kikonai Town. The 
population of Matsumae peaked at 20,072 in 1955. #7
	Distinctive industries in Matsumae are fishery, food processing 
(mainly Surume and Matsumae-zuke), and sightseeing. STATISTICS OF 
AGRICULTURE = fodder 192 hectares in 2015, pasture 154, and paddy rice 
X (concealed); dairy cows - (zero) in 2015. STATISTICS OF FISHERIES = 
squid (flying squid 540 tons in 2017, other squid 154), snow crabs 442, 
	(continued) --> atka mackerel 334, sea urchins 126, tuna 92, 
Pacific cod 61, Konbu kelp (cultured) 57, octopus 49, sharks 47, olive 
flounder 6, shrimp/prawns 5, walleye pollock 4, abalone (cultured) 2, 
yellowtail 1, herring -, other fish 29+X, and other marine animals 11.
#8
	As for sightseeing, Matsumae Castle is famous for cherry 
blossoms. There is a botanical garden with 10,000 cherry trees of 250 
varieties. #9
	There are many temples in Matsumae, because it was a castle 
town. Tourists enjoy seeing the architecture and gardens. In the past, 
monks were like civil servants today, because they could read and 
write.
  
#1  The southernmost part of Hokkaidou island is Cape Shirakami along 
National Route 228 in Matsumae Town. The location is 41 degrees 23.87 
minutes north latitude and 140 degrees 11.86 minutes east longitude.
 	If small islands are counted, the southernmost part of 
Hokkaidou is Kojima island. The island is also called Matsumae-kojima 
or Oshima-kojima. It is an uninhabited island.
	Ooshima island is the largest uninhabited island in the country 
The area is 9.7 square kilometers. The island is also called Matsumae-
ooshima or Oshima-ooshima.
	 Ooshima island is a volcano. It erupted in 1741 and caused 
tidal waves that killed 1,467 people in the Matsumae Domain and 566 
people in the Tsugaru Domain. (The Matsumae Domain ruled the south of 
Hokkaidou island during the Edo era. The Tsugaru Domain ruled the west 
of today's Aomori Prefecture.)
	Tourists cannot land Ooshima island and Kojima islands. In the 
island, only shelters for fishing boats exist. Those islands are 
breeding grounds of seabirds such as Umigarasu (murre) and Oomizunagi-
dori (Ostreaked shearwater).

#2  As for the Tsugaru Strait, the distance between Cape Shirakami 
(Matsumae Town) and Cape Tappizaki (Sotogahama Town, Aomori Prefecture) 
is 19.5 kilometers. The distance between Cape Shiokubi in the former 
Toi Town (now Hakodate City) and Cape Ooma (Ooma Town, Aomori 
Prefecture) is 19.0 kilometers.
	The Seikan undersea tunnel was constructed on Matsumae Town's 
side. The water is longer, however, shallower. (See the note of 
Hakaodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the Tsugaru Strait).
 
#3  The warlord Nobuhiro Takeda ended the Koshamain's Ware in 1457. He 
was a vassal of the Andou clan. (See Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-
prefecture for Nobuhiro Takeda.) His great-grandson, Suehiro Kakizaki, 
made peace with Ainu chiefs around 1549.
	Yoshihiro Kakizaki, who was the son of Suehiro Kakizaki, became 
independent from the Andou clan in 1593. He was able to ask Hideyoshi 
Toyotomi, the ruler of Japan at the time, for the land of Ezo (now 
Hokkaidou). The meeting was arranged by the Maeda clan, the ruler of 
the Kaga Domain (now Ishikawa Prefecture).
	In 1599, after the death of Hideyoshi Toyotomi, Yoshihiro 
Kakizaki gave maps of Ezo to Ieyasu Tokugawa, who was the founder of 
the Tokugawa Shogunate. Maps were important for governing lands during 
the Warring States era. Giving maps meant obedience.
	In 1604, during the early Edo era, the Tokugawa Shogunate 
appointed Yoshihiro Kakizaki as the lord of the Matsumae Domain. He 
changed his family name from Kakizaki to Matsumae.
	 Therefore, there is a story that the place name ``Matsumae'' 
comes from to Matsudaira (Tokugawa's family name) and Maeda. (The 
Tokugawa Shogunate, whose capital was set in Edo [now Tokyo], 
continued from 1903 to 1867. The Edo era ended in 1868.)

#4  In Hokkaidou, 1st-class (ikkyuu) and 2nd-class (nikyuu) 
municipalities were designated from 1899 to 1943. The Hokkaidou 
government subsidized 2nd-class municipalities. Those were pioneering 
years.

#5  As for the former Sumiyaki-zawa village, a novelist Sei Itou was 
born in the village. The name ``Sumi-yaki-zawa'' means ``charcoal, 
burn, stream'' in Japanese.
	Sei Itou was influenced by James Joyce, an Irish novelist. 
Sei Itou was one of the translators of Ulysses by James Joyce. The 
Japanese translation was published from 1931 to 1933. (See the note of 
Otaru City in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for Sei Itou.)
	Joyce published his novels in English (not Celtic) and died in 
Zurich. These are Irish novelists besides Joyce; Jonathan Swift, 
William Butler Yeats, and Oscar Wilde. They published their work in 
English rather than their native language. They were discontented.

#6  Fukuyama Castle is the former name of Matsumae Castle. The castle 
was designated as a national treasure of Japan, however, it was burned 
in 1949.
	The only national treasure in Hokkaidou now is a clay figurine. 
It was dug out from a potato field. (See the note of Hakodate City in 
Oshima sub-prefecture for the national treasure.)

#7  Matsumae Town is a sister city with Oumi-hachiman City in Shiga 
Prefecture and Yanagawa Town (now Date City) in Fukushima Prefecture. 
The reasons date back to the Edo era.
	Merchants from Oumi-hachiman were called Hachiman-shounin. 
They traded in Ezo using the north-bound ship, Kitamae-bune. They based 
in the castle town of Matsumae. They developed herring fishing grounds.
	As for the Town of Yanagawa, in 1807, the Tokugawa Shogunate 
directly ruled Ezo to prevent Russian southward movement. The vassals 
of Matsumae Domain were forced to moved to Yanagawa, because the 
Mastumae Domain's attitude towards the Russians was judged to be bad 
by the Tokugawa Shogunate.
	Half of the vassals became rounin (jobless samurai). They 
lived in hardship for 14 years until the Matsumae Domain was returned 
to Ezo in 1821.

#8  Surume is dried flying squid. Matsumae and neighboring Fukushima 
are the largest producers of dried flying squid in the country. The 
tonnages of the towns account for 80 percent of the national share. In 
the late Meiji period (about 100 years ago), herring fishing decreased 
and flying squid fishing prospered.
	In the past, fishers processed flying squid into surume (dried 
flying squid). As catches increased, local companies started processing 
flying squid after the 1970s (by Matsumae Town's website ``History of 
Matsumae Surume,'' last accessed May 2019).
	Matsumae-zuke is pickles made with Konbu kelp, dried flying 
squid, and herring roe. A variety of Matsumae-zuke are sold at 
``Dosanko Plaza,'' which is a souvenir shop in Sapporo Station. In the 
past, when herring catches were poor, Matsumae-zuke without herring 
roe was sold.

#9  These are famous cherry blossom sites in Hokkaidou; (1) Matsumae 
Castle (Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture), (2) Goryoukaku [go-
ryou-kaku] Castle (Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture), (3) Rows of 
cherry trees that lead to Noboribetsu Hot Spring (Noboribetsu City in 
Iburi sub-prefecture), 
	(continued) --> (4) Nijikken Road in Shizunai (now Shin-hidaka 
Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture), and (5) Shiokari Pass (Wassamu Town in 
Kamikawa sub-prefecture).
	These are the main cherry varieties and cherry blossom viewing 
sites; (1) Yaezakura (double-flowered cherry) and many other varieties 
including Somei-yoshino in Matsmae Castle, (2) Somei-yoshino in 
Goryoukaku Castle, (3) and Ezo-yamazakura (Hokkaidou mountain cherry) 
in Shizunai.
	The best time to see cherry blossoms varies year by year, 
however, generally, it is from late April to mid May in Matsumae Town 
and from early to mid May in Shizunai.
	Somei-yoshino is the most famous cherry variety in the country. 
It was bred in Somei village near Edo (now the center of Tokyo) in the 
end of the Edo era. Somei village was located near present-day 
Ikebukuro.
	Somei-yoshino was named after Mt. Yoshino, a famous cherry 
blossom site in Nara Prefecture. (The cherries in Mt. Yoshino are 
mountain cherries.) One of the oldest Somei-yoshino trees in the 
country exists at Matsumae Castle. It was planted in 1882 (Meiji 15).
	Trees of Somei-yoshino are clones. If the soil and climate are 
the same, they grow in the same ways; the hight of the tree, the 
diameter of the trunk, and the twistness of the trunk. 
	Therefore, Somei-yoshino are used as an indicator for the 
cherry blossom season. Making plant clones are easier than animal 
clones. Clones are more alike than siblings. Plant clones are the 
predecessors of today's digital society (Nihei lab 2024a).

Fukushima [fu-ku-shi-ma] [\u798F\u5CF6] is a town in Oshima sub-
prefecture, south Hokkaidou (dou-nan). The area faces the Tsugaru 
Strait to the south. The Fukushima River and the Shiriuchi River flow.
	Mt. Daisenguen (1,072 meters) rises to the north. Forests cover 
93 percent of the area. Matsumae county, which consists of Matsumae 
Town and Fukushima Town, is the southern end of Hokkaidou.
	The name ``Fukushima'' is Japanese. ``Fuku-shima'' means 
``lucky, island.'' It is a good-luck name that was given by an oracle 
from Tsukizaki Shrine in 1624. #1 #2
	The first Japanese immigrants to Ezo (now Hokkaidou) came from 
Ooshuu (now Touhoku region) in 1189. They were vassals of the Fujiwara 
clan that were defeated by Yoritomo Minamoto. (Yoritomo Minamoto 
established the Kamakura Shogunate after he conquered Ooshuu.) They 
lived in what is now Yoshioka district.
	In the mid 15th century, there was a fort called Onnai-date in 
Yoshioka district. The fort was destroyed by the Ainu forces during 
Koshamain's War. (See the note of Kaminokuni Town in Oshima sub-
prefecture for the war.)
	In the Edo era, the area was ruled by the Matsumae Domain. 
Around 1617, a gold mine opened in Mt. Daisenguen [dai-sen-guen]. 
Catholic gold miners gathered on the mountain. #3
 	In the beginning of the Meiji period, the area belonged to the 
Tate Domain. (The Matsumae domain renamed the Tate Domain.) (See 
Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for Tate Domain.) 
	In 1879 (Meiji 12), two administrative offices (kochou-yakuba) 
were established; one was for two villages (Fukushima and Shirafu 
[\u767D\u7B26]) and the other was for three villages (Yoshioka 
[\u5409\u5CA1], Reihige [\u793C\u9AED], and Miyanouta [\u5BAE
\u6B4C]).
	In 1900 (Meiji 33), Fukushima Village (1st-class municipality) 
was established by the merger of Fukushima village and Shirafu village. 
(See the note of Matsumae Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class 
municipalities.)
	In 1902 (Meiji 35), Yoshioka Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established by the merger of Yoshioka, Reihige, and Miyanouta 
villages. In 1944 (Shouwa 19), Fukushima Town was established. In 1955 
(Shouwa 30), Fukushima Town and Yoshioka Village were merged.
 	The town hall of Fukushima and the center of the town are 
located near the mouth of the Fukushima River. National Route 228 
(Fukuyama-kaidou) runs. #4
	Previously, the Matsumae Line ran along the national route. 
The railway connected Matsumae Station and Kikonai Station. On the 
Kaikyou Line, there was Yoshioka-kaitei Station, which was an undersea 
station of the Seikan Tunnel. #5
	Distinctive industries in Fukushima are fishery and forestry. 
STATISTICS OF AGRICULTIRE = paddy rice X (concealed) in 2015; dairy 
cows - (zero) in 2015. STATISTICS OF FISHERIES = squid (flying squid 
895 tons in 2017, other squid 26), sea urchins 85, tuna 66, octopus 48, 
	(continud) --> seaweed (Konbu kelp 24, other seaweed 10), olive 
flounder 6, sea trout 6, atka mackerel 6, right-eye flounder 1, abalone 
1, herring 0, other fish 10, and other marine animals 3. 
	Fishing ports are located in Fukushima, Yoshioka, Shirafu, and 
Urawa. The catch of squid accounts for about 80 percent of the fishery. 
Fukushima and neighboring Matsumae are the leading producers of Surume 
(dried flying squid) in the country. (See Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-
prefecture for Surume production.)
	As for forestry, the main trees are cedar ['si-dar], fir (Todo-
matsu), and spruce (Ezo-matsu). The ceder is sold as the trade-name 
Dou-nan-sugui (South Hokkaidou Cedar). #6
	As for sightseeing in Fukushima Town, there are Seikan Tunnel 
Memorial Hall, Inou Tadataka Hokkaidou Survey Memorial Park, and 
Yokozuna Chiyo-no-Yama and Chiyo-no-Fuji Memorial Hall. ``Yokozuna'' 
means the champions of Sumou wrestling. (See Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama 
sub-prefecture for Tadataka Inou.)
	The country sign (gateway sign) of the town shows a squid Sumou 
wrestler. The name of the roadside station is Yokozuna-no-sato. It 
means the hometown of Sumou champions.
  
#1  According to ``Fukushima Town History (Fukushima-chou-shi) Volume 
2'' published in 1995, once upon a time, Orikanai village was on the 
verge of being abandoned, because of a large fire happened and the 
fishing was poor. At the time, there was an oracle from Tsukisaki 
Shrine. It said, ``The name Orikanai must be changed to Fukushima.''
	The name ``Fukushima'' may have referred to Fukuyama, which was 
a neighboring castle town. Fukuyama was the former name of Matsumae 
Town. ``Fuku-yama'' means ``lucky, mountain'' and ``Fuku-shima'' means 
``lucky, island.''
	The original name of Fukushima was ``Orikanai.'' It comes from 
``horka-nay'' in Ainu language. It means ``reverse, river.'' It 
signified the Fukushima River. Seawater entered the estuary at high 
tide. The etymology is the same as Horokanai Town in Kamikawa sub-
prefecture.

#2  These are old shrines in Fukushima Town; (1) Tsukisaki Shrine, 
which was reconstructed in 1492, (2) Fukushima Daijinguu Shrine, which 
was reconstructed in 1573, (3) Shirafu Daijinguu Shrine, which was 
established by the Matsumae Domain in 1655, and (4) Kamaya Shrine, 
which was established in 1772.
	Shirafu Daijinguu Shirine preserves a traditional dance.
It is Shirafu-arauma-odori (Shirafu, wild horse, dance). The dance 
represented the power of the Matsumae Domain. It has been designated as 
a national cultural heritage.
	Kamaya Shrine is located in Shiogama district. ``Shio-gama'' is 
Japanese. It Japanese means ``salt, pot.'' The name was derived from 
the production of salt for sardine fishing.

#3  The name Mt. ``Daisenguen [dai-sen-guen]'' is Japanese. It means 
``large, thousand, houses.'' It signified the 1,000 houses of gold 
miners. During the Edo era, the Tokugawa Shogunate banned Christianity, 
however, the regulation was loose in Ezo island, because the island 
was considered as an outer land (Gaichi).
	Christians revolted in Kyuushuu island in 1637. That led to the 
execution of Christians in Ezo island in 1639. At the site of the gold 
mine in Mt. Daisenguen, there is an inscription that reads ``Christian 
martyrdom.''

#4  As for Fukuyama-kaidou (Fukuyama trail), the name ``Fukuyama'' 
refers the former Matsumae Town. The Fukuyama-kaidou was an old trail 
that connected Fukuyama Castle (Matsume Castle) and Hakodate. The 
samurais of the Matsumae Domain walked the trail. The distance was 
about 100 kilometers.
	Matsumae-kaidou was located in Tsugaru, now Aomori Prefecture. 
(See the note of Hokuto City in Oshima sub-prefecture for Matsumae-
kaidou).

#5  The Seikan Tunnel is an undersea railway tunnel. The length is 54 
kilometers. Channel Tunnel (Le tunnel sous la Mance) between England 
and France is 50 kilometers and Gotthard Base Tunnel in Switzerland is 
57 kilometers. (Cf. The total length of tunnels in a large coal mine 
reached 200 kilometers; See Akabira City in Sorachi sub-prefecture.) 
	Yoshioka-kaitei Station in Fukushima Town was built at 150 
meters under the sea. It was used for sigtseeing and the maintenance of 
the undersea tunnel. Yoshioka-kaitei Station was closed in 2006 and 
demolished in 2014.
	Yoshioka district was the base for the construction of Seikan 
Tunnel. The undersea tunnel was constructed from 1961 to 1988. Yoshioka 
was flourishing during the construction of the tunnel. (See Kikonai 
Town and Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the undersea 
tunnel.)

#6  Cedar trees are not common in Hokkaidou, therefore, cedar pollen 
fever is rare in the island. However, white birch and alder cause 
pollen fever in Hokkaidou. I did not hear about pollen fever when I 
was a child in the 1970s. Cedar forests in the country were still 
young at the time. 
	Cedars grow even on wet land, therefore, farmers in Honshuu 
island planted cedars on abandoned rice paddies near valley heads. It 
happened during the high economic growth period between the late 1960s 
and the early 1970s. Farm successors left the countryside. Land use 
changed from agricultural to forest. Taxes were reduced.

SHINKANSEN, OYSTER, & NIRA GIRL.

Shiriuchi [shi-ri-u-chi] [\u77E5\u5185] is a town in Oshima sub-
prefecture, south Hokkaidou (dou-nan). It is located in the southwest 
of the Oshima Peninsula. The part is called Matsumae Peninsula. The 
area of Shiriuchi faces the Tsugaru Strait to the east. Forests cover 
87 percent of the area.
	The name ``Shiriuchi`` comes from ``cir-ot-i'' in Ainu 
language. It means ``bird, exist, place.'' It signified the Shiriuchi 
River. In the Edo era, Shiriuchi was a hunting ground for hawks and 
falcons. Young hawks and falcons were caught and shipped to Edo (now 
Tokyo) for falconry. #1
 	In 1205, the feudal lord of Kai Province (now Yamanashi 
Prefecture) started gold dust gathering along the Shiriuchi River. It 
was the order of the Kamakura Shogunate.
	In the 15th century, there was a fort called Wakimoto-date [da-
te]. It was one of the 12 forts that were built by the Andou clan from 
Tsugaru (now Aomori Prefecture). During the Edo era, the land that is 
now Shiriuchi was ruled by the Matsumae Domain. #2
	After the Meiji period, in 1871 (Meiji 4), the administrative 
office (kochou-yakuba) of Shiriuchi village was established. It was a 
continuation of village chief system from the Edo era.
	In 1881 (Meiji 14), the administrative office (kochou-yakuba) 
of Shiriuchi village was re-established. It covered Kotaniishi [\u5C0F
\u8C37\u77F3] village (by ``Shin-Shiriuchi-choushi [new Shiriuchi Town 
history]'' published in 2015).
	In 1906 (Meiji 39), Shiriuchi Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established by the merger of Shiriuchi village and Kotaniishi 
village. (See the note of Matsumae Town for 2nd-class municipality). In 
1967 (Shouwa 42), Shiriuchi Town was established.
	The town hall of Shiriuchi and the center of the town are 
located near the mouth of the Shiriuchi River. National Route 228 
(Fukuyama-kaidou) runs. (The name ``Fukuyama'' means the castle town of 
the Matsumae Domain. It is also the former name of Matsumae Town.)
	The national route runs along the coast, goes inland from the 
center of the town, and leads to Fukushima Town. Previously, there 
was Shiriuchi Station on the Matsumae Line, which was operated by 
Japanese National Railways. #3
	Also, there was another Shiriuchi Station on the Kaikyou Line. 
It became a roadside station (Michi-no-eki). Visitors can watch the 
Shinkansen coming out of the undersea tunnel. #4
 	Distinctive industries in Shiriuchi are agriculture, fishery, 
forestry, and power generation. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 
422 hectares in 2015, soybeans 124, buckwheat 85, pasture 54, 
	(continued) --> fodder 18, spinach 14, wheat 3, potatoes 2, 
orchards 1, flowers 1, and other vegetables 95+X (including Nira 
[Chinese chive or gynmigit]); dairy cows 112 head in 2015. STATISTICS 
OF FISHERIES = squid (flying squid 296 tons in 2017, other squid 20), 
	(continued) --> salmon 66, sea urchins 30, seaweed 13 (Konbu 
kelp), shellfish 11 (oysters), olive flounder 10, right-eye flounder 6 
(marbled flounder), octopus 5, anchovy 4, yellowtail 4, sharks 1, 
mackerel 1, herring 0, other fish 20, and other marine animals 3.
 	According to a study on agricultural regionalization, the town 
was classified as an area of ``small-scale and single-crop production 
of paddy rice.'' Due to the decrease in rice consumption, the area of 
paddy rice decreased, and the area of Nira (Chinese chive) increased.
	Today, Shiriuchi is the largest producer of Nira in Hokkaidou. 
Nira is cultivated in greenhouses and harvested from January to 
October. Nira is the vegetable included in Gyouza dumplings. #5 #6 
  
#1  In the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain traded hawks and falcons. (Hawk 
is ``taka'' and falcon is ``hayabusa'' in Japanese.) There were many 
bird-catching places in Ezo (now Hokkaidou). Among them, Shiriuchi was 
the one of the best bird-catching places.
	Taka-machi (hawk catchers) searched nests of hawks in summer. 
They wintered in Ezo, caught chicks of hawks in spring, and sold them 
to the Matsumae Domain. The birds were shipped to the Tokugawa 
Shogunate in Edo. Feathers of hawks were also traded for making arrow 
fletchings.
	Ainu people also caught hawks and sold them to Japanese people. 
Ainu hunters hid in huts nearby streams, using salmon as lure. When 
hawks appeared, Ainu hunters caught them by hooking their legs.
	Ainu people also kept hawks to take feathers. They also kept 
young bears. To Ainu poeple, bears were gods. (See Noboribetsu City in 
Iburi sub-prefecture for bear lanch.)

#2  Shiriuchi Town has a long history of Japanese immigrants. Wakimoto 
Shrine in Kitsune-goshi district was established in 1239. Raikou Shrine 
in the center of the town was established in 1244. Shiriuchi Hot Spring 
was discovered by gold miners in 1247.
	 These are very old shrines and a hot spring in Hokkaidou. 
Even in Musashino and Sagamihara in Honshuu island, which are currently 
the suburbs of Tokyo and Yokohama, many shrines are newer than these.
In the past, the priests of shrines were like village chiefs, because 
they could write documents.
	Fort Wakimoto-date was located in Wakimoto district. It was 
located near Cape Kitsune-goshi. The fort was destroyed by the Ainu 
forces during Koshamain's War. (See Kaminokuni Town in Oshima sub-
prefecture for the war.) 

#3  The road along the sea is a dead end, because there are steep sea 
cliffs. Cape Kitsune-goshi is located to the south of Wakimoto 
district. Wakimoto is one of the oldest villages in Hokkaidou. The name 
``Kitsune-goshi'' is Japanese. It means ``fox, pass.''
	To the west of Cape Kitsune-goshi is Kotaniishi district. To 
the west of Kotaniishi district is a dead end at Cape Yagoshi.  Cape 
Yagoshi is a sea cliff of 121 meter high. The name ``Ya-goshi'' is 
Japanese. It means ``arrow, pass.''

#4  The observatory of Shiriuchi Roadside Station has a time table for 
the Shinkansen trains (bullet trains) entering and leaving the undersea 
Seikan Tunnel.
	Part of the former Shiriuchi Station on the Kaikyou Line became 
Yu-no-sato Signal Station. It is the end of the undersea tunnel. There 
was another Yu-no-sato Station on the former Matsumae Line.
	The name ``Yu-no-sato'' is Japanese. It means ``village of hot 
spring.'' It is a place name along the Shiriuchi River. There is 
Shiriuchi Hot Spring. (See Kikonai Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 
the Kaikyou Line.)

#5  Oysters of Shiriuchi are cultivated in the open sea. It is a unique 
method, because oysters are generally farmed along the coast. Shiriucih 
Oysters are advertised at tasting events in Susukino, the largest 
entertainment district in Hokkaidou.
	As for power generation, Shiriuchi Power Plant is located in 
Motomachi district. It is operated by Hokkaidou Electric Power Company, 
is located in Motomachi district. The power station uses heavy oil and 
Orimulsion, a new type of fossil fuel.
	In summer, the power plant sells electricity to Tokyo Electric 
Power Company. People in the Tokyo metropolitan area consumes a huge 
amount of electricity in the hot and humid summer.
	The electricity is carried by power cables in the undersea 
Seikan Tunnel. The power cables are direct current. It is suitable for 
high voltage and long-distance transmission.

#6  As for sightseeing, Shiriuchi is the hometown of Saburou Kitajima, 
a famous Enka singer. (Enka is a traditional style Japanese music). 
There is Kitajima Memorial Museum in Hakodate City.
	When I guided an excursion in Tokyo, we happened to pass by the 
Enka singer's residence. It was near the former site of another Enka 
singer's residence. Students did not know them. Time has passed.
	This is one of Kitajima's famous songs;
``Yosaku-wa-ki-wo-kiru, hey hey hoo
  (Yosaku cuts trees, hey hey hoo).''
When I hear the song, I imagine a forestry office (Eirin-sho) in 
Hokkaidou. Forests are huge in the north island.

Kikonai [ki-ko-na-i] [\u6728\u53E4\u5185] is a town in Oshima sub-
prefecture, south Hokkaidou (dou-nan). It is located in the southwest 
of the Oshima Peninsula. The part is also called Matsumae Peninsula. 
The area of Kikonai faces the Tsugaru Strait. Forests cover 88 percent 
of the area.
	The name ``Kikonai'' comes from ``rir-o-nay'' in Ainu language. 
It means ``tide, enter, stream.'' It signified the Kikonai River. 
Saltwater entered the estuary at high tide.
	In the 15th century, Nakano-date (a fort) existed. It was one 
of 12 forts in Ezo (old Hokkaidou), which was built by the Andou clan. 
(See Kaminokuni Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the old 12 forts.) In 
the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain ruled the area. The name ``Kikonai'' 
appears on the map of Ezo, which was drawn by the Matsumae Domain in 
1624.
	After the Meiji period, in 1879 (Meiji 12), the administrative 
office (kochou-yakuba) of Kikonai was established. In 1902 (Meiji 35), 
Kikonai Village (2nd-class municipality) was established. At the time, 
these four villages were merged; Kikonai, Kamatani [\u91DC\u8C37], 
Izumisawa [\u6CC9\u6CA2], and Sakkari [\u672D\u82C5]. (See the note of 
Matsumae Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.)
	In 1919 (Taishou 8), Kikonai Village (1st-class municipality) 
was established. In 1942 (Shouwa 17), Kikonai Town was established. 
#1 #2
	The town hall of Kikonai and the center of the town are located 
near the mouth of the Kikonai River. National Route 228 (Fukuyama-
kaidou) runs through the center of the town. Kikonai Station on the 
Hokkaidou Shinkansen is the terminal of the Dou-nan Isaribi Railway. #3
	The name ``Isaribi'' is Japanese. It means ``fishing lamp.''
Lamps for squid fishing are floating on the sea. (The fishing season 
of sauid is from June to December; See Hakodate City and Matsumae Town 
in Oshima sub-prefecture for squid fishing.)
	In the past, the Esashi Line and the Matsumae Line ran. Kikonai 
was a transportation hub in the Matsumae Peninsula. Governmental 
offices were located in the center of the town such as a summary court, 
a forestry office (eirin-sho), and a railway yard by Japanese National 
Railways. #4
	Distinctive industries in Kikonai are fishery, agriculture, 
animal husbandry (including Hakodate Wagyuu Beef), and forestry 
(including Dou-nan Ceder). STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 291 
hectares in 2015, pasture 188, fodder 26, orchards 5, potatoes 4, 
	(continued) --> spinach 2, soybeans 1, radishes 1, and yams 1; 
dairy cows 291 head in 2015, and beef cattle X (concealed). STATISTICS 
OF FISHERIERS = salmon 65 tons in 2017 (autumn salmon), sea urchins 22, 
seaweed 18 (Konbu, Wakame, and Iwa-nori kelps), 
	(continued) --> shellfish (abalone 1, other shellfish 10), 
olive flounder 14, right-eye flounder 9 (marbled flounder), octopus 8, 
mackerel 5, sharks 4, yellowtail 1, Pacific cod 1, herring 0, other 
fish 7, and other marine animals 6. #5
	The country sign (gateway sign) of Kikonai signifies Kanchuu-misogi, 
which means ``winter, purification'' in Japanese. It is a festival that started 
in 1831. During the festival, people go into the sea in the middle of winter. 
(The temperature of the sea in winter is warmer than lakes and rivers in 
winter, however, the location is Hokkaidou island.)
  
#1  As for the Boshin War, the battle of Kikonai happened in 1869 
(Meiji 2). The Meiji government forces advanced from Esashi to 
Hakodate. The former Tokugawa Shogunate forces counter-attacked. 
	One of the routes taken by the Meiji government forces was the 
Kikonai Mountain Trail. (See Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for 
the Boshin War.)

#2  In 1871 (Meiji 4), Kanrin-maru (a ship) sank at Cape Saraki in 
Kikonai. The anchor of the ship is displayed in Kikonai Town's museum. 
Along National Route 228, there is a monument to the ship that reads 
``End-of-Kanrin-mauru.''
	Kanrin-maru was a battleship that the Tokugawa Shogunate 
purchased from the Netherlands. It was the first Japanese ship that 
crossed the Pacific Ocean. In 1860, to complete the conclusion of the 
Japan-US Treaty of Amity and Commerce, Kanrin-maru departed from the 
Port of Shinagawa on January 13th.
	Kanrin-maru arrived in the Port of San Francisco on February 
26th. The captain was Kaishuu Katsu and the interpreter was Manjirou 
John. On the outbound voyage, bad weather caused Japanese crew to be 
sea-sick, and Americans took over piloting.
	In 1867, the steam of Kanrin-maru was removed. It became a 
cargo ship. After the Meiji period, the new government owned the ship. 
It sank in a heavy storm in September 1871 along the coast of Kikonai.

#3  Hokkaidou Shinkansen opened in 2016. It is operated by JR Hokkaidou.
In the same year, the Esashi Line changed to the Dou-nan Isaribi 
Railway. The operation was transferred from JR Hokkaidou to South 
Hokkaidou Railway Company. 
	The Esashi Line ran along the coast of the Tsugaru Strait, 
connecting Goryoukaku [go-ryou-kaku] Station in Hakodate City and 
Kikonai Station. In the past, the Esashi Line entered mountains from 
Kikonai Town and went to Esashi Town on the sea of Japan side.
	In 2012, Kikonai High School was closed. In 2014, a section 
between Kikonai Station and Esashi Station closed. High school students 
are the main users of local railways. Part of the abolished Esashi Line 
was converted to a trolley line for sightseeing.
	Kikonai Station on Hokkaidou Shinkansen is also the terminal of 
the Kaikyou Line. The Kakyou Line runs through the undersea Seikan 
Tunnel. After the opening of the Hokkaidou Shinkansen, only freight 
trains and special trains for group tours use the Kaikyou Line.
	The Hokkaidou Shinkansen uses the same undersea tunnel, 
however, the Shinkansen is not categorized as the Kaikyou line. The 
track gauge (distance between two rails) is different between the 
Shinkansen and conventional railways including the Kaikyou Line.
	The Seikan Tunnel was made as a dual-gauge (three rails) and 
double-truck railway. There are six rails in the tunnel. (See 
Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the undersea tunnel.)
	The former Matsumae Line connected Kikonai Station and Matsumae 
Station. The railway was abolished in 1988. It was two years after the 
privatization of JNR (Japanese National Railways). In the past, there 
were JNR-branded ashtrays in passenger cars.
	There were many railways and branch routes in Hokkaidou. In the 
past, many local politicians promised many railways.

#4  Woodworking factories were also located around Kikonai Station. Old 
television sets were made from wooden planks. Nowadays, all desks and 
chairs are made of steel in Japanese offices.
	When I had a zoom meeting with a professor in Vietnam, I saw a 
wooden door behind his face. I liked it. When I visited an office 
of professor in Sao Paulo, I found a wooden desk and a wooden book 
shelf. I liked them. (My office is like a used book store whose space 
is occupied by steel shelves.)

#5  As for dairy farming in Kikonai, in 1897 (Meiji 30), a milk 
collection facility was built. Horse-drawn carriage shipped raw milk to 
Toubetsu Trappist Monastery.
	In 1919 (Taishou 8), condensed milk butter (ren-nyuu butter) 
was produced in Kikonai. (See Hokuto City in Oshima sub-prefecture for 
the monastery; See Eniwa City in Ishikari sub-prefecture for dairy 
farming.)

Hokuto [ho-ku-to] [\u5317\u6597] is a city in Oshima sub-prefecture, 
south Hokkaidou (dou-nan). The area faces Hakodate Bay and the Tsugaru 
Strait. The rivers of Moheji, Oono, and Kunebetsu flow.
	The name ``Hokuto'' is Japanese. It means the Big Dipper that 
shines in the north sky. It was named by public offering when Kamiiso 
[\u4E0A\u78EF] and Oono [\u5927\u91CE] towns were merged in 2006. #1
	In the mid 15th century, Mobetsu-date [da-te] (a fort) was 
built near the mouth of the Moheji River. (See Kaminokuni Town in 
Hiyama sub-prefecture for the old forts built in south Hokkaidou.) In 
the Edo era, the area was ruled by the Matsumae Domain.
	After the Meiji period, in 1880 (Meiji 13), two administrative 
offices (kochou-yakuba) were established in the villages of Kamiiso 
and Oono. In 1885 (Meiji 18), an administrative office was established 
in Moheji [\u8302\u8FBA\u5730] village.
	In 1900 (Meiji 33), Kamiiso Village (1st-class municipality) 
and Oono Village (1st-class municipality) were established. (See the 
note of Matsumae Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.)
	In 1906 (Meiji 39), Mobetsu [\u8302\u5225] Village (2nd-class 
municipality) was established by the merger of Moheji and Ishibetsu 
[\u77F3\u5225] villages. In 1918 (Taishou 7), Kamiiso Town was 
established. In 1955 (Shouwa 30), Kamiiso Town merged Mobetsu Village. 
In 1957 (Shouwa 32), Oono Town was established.
	The city hall of Hokuto is located near the mouth of the Oono 
River. It used to be the town hall of Kamiiso Town. National Route 228 
(Fukuyama-kaidou) and the Dou-nan Isaribi Railway run through the 
center of the city. (See Kikonai Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the 
Dou-nan Isaribi Railway; See Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-prefecture 
for Fukuyama-kaidou.) #2
	The population of Hokuto City increased. To the south, 
residential, commercial, and manufacturing areas extend from the center 
of Hakodate City. 
	To the north, National Route 227 (Oono-kokudou) runs through 
the Oono Plain, crosses the ridge, and continues to Esashi Town. Shin-
hakodate-hokuto Station on the Hokkaidou Shinkansen is located near the 
border with Nanae Town. It used to be Oshima-Oono Station on the 
Hakodate Main Line. 
	Distinctive industries in Hokuto are manufacturing, 
agriculture, and fishery. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 1,198 
hectares in 2015, fodder 659, beans (soybeans 239, adzuki beans 9, 
other beans 5), green onions 131, pasture 110, radishes 57, tomatoes 
50, potatoes 39, spinach 37, cabbage 28, Chinese cabbage 16, 
	(continued) --> lettuce 14, cucumbers 14, orchards 11, 
strawberries 9, yams 6, flowers 4, onions 2, other vegetables 139+X,

21, sea urchins 15, mackerel 13, octopus 11, sea trout 7, puffer fish 
2, red seabream 1, other fish 44+X, and other marine animals 10.
	On satellite images, a straight line stretches to Hakodate Bay. 
It is a jetty of Taiheiyou Cement Kamiiso Factory. The limestone 
deposit for the cement industry was discovered in 1872 by Benjamin 
Smith Lyman, who was an American mining scholar invited by the Meiji 
government. #3
	As for agriculture in Hokuto, paddy rice cultivation started in 
Oono district in the late 17th century. It was the first rice 
cultivation in Hokkaidou. #4
	As for sightseeing, the old building drawn on the country sign 
(gateway sign) is Toubetsu Trappist Monastery. The monastery is located 
to the west, near the border with Kikonai Town. Its old red-brick 
buildings and tree-lined avenues are famous. #5
  
#1  The former Kamiiso Town was located along Hakodate Bay. The name 
``Kamiiso'' is derived from Kamiiso county, which was established in 
1869 (Meiji 2). The name of the county was suggestion by Takeshirou 
Matsuura, who explored Ezo (now Hokkaidou) in the Edo era.
	The name ``Kami-iso'' is Japanese. It means ``upper, coast.'' 
The ``upper'' refers to the west, where the castle of the Matsumae 
Domain was located. Or, the name is derived from Kamiiso-kaidou (an 
old trail) in Tsugaru (now Aomori Prefecture).
	Kamiiso-kaidou (Kamiiso trail) in Tsugaru was also called 
Matsumae-kaidou. It connected Abura-kawa (now part of Aomori City) and 
Min-maya (now part of Sotoga-hama Town, Aomori Prefecture).
	Fukuyama-kaidou (Fukuyama trail) connected the castle town of 
the Matsumae Domain (now Matsumae Town) and the Port of Hakodate. It 
was named because the castle town was called Fukuyama. (See Fukushima 
Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for Fukuyama-kaidou)
	In the Edo era, there were villages of Arikawa [\u6709\u5DDD] 
and Hekirichi [\u6238\u5207\u5730] in the former Kamiiso Town. The 
old names reminds in Hokuto City.
	* * *
	The former Oono Town was located inland. The name ``Oo-no'' is 
Japanese. It means ``large, plain.'' It is an old place name that was 
documented in the Gouchou [\u90F7\u5E33] (village record) written in 
1700 (Edo era).

#2  Once, I traveled on National Route 228 (Fukuyama-kaidou) on a bus
excursion.  I saw many concrete wave-breaking blocks along the coast. 
Hokuto City is one of the largest cement producers in the country. 
(Concrete is made from cement.)
	Wave-breaking blocks are known as Tetrapods in Japan. It was 
the patent of Neyrpic, a French company. I heard like this from 
Professor Sunamura at University of Tsukuba in 1995 (HTTP://
2242.MOOO.COM/POSI/95IZU/1452.JPG HTTP://2242.MOOO.COM/POSI/95IZU/
README.TXT); 
 	``When executives of Neyrpic visited Japan, they found many 
fake Tetrapods along the coast. Then, Nippon Tetrapod, a branch of 
Neyrpic, was established in 1961.
	The fake Tetrapods in Japan had metal hooks for lifting. They 
were easy to install, however, they were less durable. The metal hook 
corrodes.''

#3  As for cement industry in Hokuto City, Taiheiyou Cement Kamiiso 
Facotory extracts limestone at Garou Mine. The cement is transported to 
the ship via a long jetty. The length is two kilometers. It makes a 
long line on the map.
	In 1884 (Meiji 17), a cement factory was established. In 1890 
(Meiji 23), Hokkaidou Cement (a company) was established. In 1915 
(Taishou 4), Asano Cement purchased Hokkaidou Cement.
	After World War II, Asano zaibatsu, which was a large 
conglomerate including Asano Cement, was dismantled. Asano Cement 
changed its name to Nihon Cement. In 1988 (Shouwa 63), Taiheiyou 
Cement was established by the merger of Nihon Cement and Chichibu Onoda 
Cement. The product name ``Asano Cement'' was used until 1998. 
	Cement is made from limestone. Limestone is a self-sufficient 
resource in the small country. Cities are like concrete jungles. 
(Concrete is made from cement.) Limestone mountains are like skeletons.
	* * *
	Today, almost all electricity poles are made of concrete. 
The oldest concrete electricity pole in the country is still used in 
Hakodate City. It was installed in 1923 (Taishou 12) to prevent 
it from burning by fire. Nowadays, tourist destinations hide 
electricity poles under the earth. I like old electricity poles. They 
are simple and modest.

#4  The former Oono Town is the birth place of paddy rice cultivation 
in Hokkaidou. It started in the Edo era. There is a stone monument that 
commemorates the first paddy rice cultivation. The inscription reads; 
	``In 1692, a farmer Sakuemon opened a paddy filed of 450 tsubo 
(0.15 hectares) using natural water and gained rice of 10 hyou (600 
kg).''
	The record was excellent at the time. Today, a good paddy field 
has a yield of 600kg per 0.1 hectares. Such paddy is called jippyo-dori 
(10-hyou gaining).
	According to oral tradition, paddy rice cultivation in the 
former Oono Town dates back to the Kanbun period (1661-1672) and 1685 
in the Edo era (by T. Hoshino ed. 1994 ``Hokkaidou-no-inasaku [Rice 
cultivation of Hokkaidou]'').
	Kametarou Ootomo was an engineer in the Edo era. He instructed 
agriculture in Oono village (now Oono district in Hokuto City). In 
1866, at the end of the Edo era, he moved to Sapporo with villagers 
to develop the area.
	 Kametarou Ootamo constructed the Ootomo Canal. It became the 
Sousei River, which flows through the center of Sapporo. He was 
Sontoku Ninomiya's disciple. (See Hokuryuu Town in Sorachi sub-
prefecture for Sontoku Ninomiya's disciple; See Toyokoro Town in 
Tokachi sub-prefecture for the thought of Sontoku Ninomiya.)
	Kyuuzou Nakayama was the manager of a post station in what 
is now Kita-hirosima City. He is known as the father of cold-climate 
paddy rice cultivation.
	 In the Meiji period, Kyuuzou Nakayama obtained rice seeds in 
Oono village and succeeded in paddy rice cultivation in the Ishikari 
Plain. (See Kita-hiroshima City in Ishikari sub-prefecture for cold-
climate rice cultivation.)

#5  Toubetsu Trappist Monastery sells butter, ice cream, and cookies. 
The monastery was established in 1896 (Meiji 29). The monks started 
dairy farming. Dairy farming spread to the farmers in neiboring 
Kikonai village in the Meiji period.
	A monastery is a place where monks live together. It is 
Catholic. It is also Catholic to have statues of Mary and saints, 
however, they do not pray to them (not idolatry).
	In the past, many people could not read, therefore, they made 
statues. (Today, university teachers use PowerPoint too much. The 
situation is like idolatry. Students need a bible.)

Hakodate [ha-ko-da-te] [\u51FD\u9928] is a city in Oshima sub-
prefecture, south Hokkaidou (dou-nan). The area faces Hakodate Bay, 
Tsugaru Strait, and the Pacific Ocean. It occupies the southeast of the 
Oshima Peninsula. The part is called Kameda Peninsula.
	Mt. Hakodate stands from Hakodate Bay. The height is 334 
meters. (Tokyo Tower is 333 meters.) The area of Hakodate was newly 
formed in 2004 by the merger of Hakodate City, Toi Town, Minami-kayabe 
Town, Esan Town, and Todohokke Village. #1 #2 #3 #4
	The name ``Hako-date'' means ``box, fort'' in Japanese. It 
referred to the shape of the fort Usukeshi-date, which was managed by 
the Kouno clan after 1454. The Kouno clan was one of the vassals of the 
Andou clan, who built 12 forts in what is now south Hokkaidou.
	Koshamain's War occurred in 1457. Usukeshi-date, so-called 
Hako-date, was destroyed by the Ainu forces. Koshamain was a chief of 
Ainu people. (See Kaminokuni Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the 
Andou clan and Koshamain's War.)
	In the Edo era, the Port of Hakodate was managed by the 
Matsumae Domain and later by the Tokugawa Shogunate. The port opened 
for American ships in 1854 under the Convention of Kanagawa (Japan-US 
Treaty of Peace and Amity). #5
 	In the beginning of the Meiji period, Hakodate was the battle 
ground of the Boshin War (1868-1869). In 1869 (Meiji 2), the Hokkaidou 
Development Commission was established. (The head office moved from 
Hakodate to Sapporo in 1871.) In 1879 (Meiji 12), Hakodate became a 
ward [\u533A]. (The ``ward'' was an administrative district). #6
	In 1899 (Meiji 32), Hakodate Ward was established. (The 
``Ward'' was a local government; See Kushiro Town in Kushiro sub-
prefecture for wards in Hokkaidou.) In 1922 (Taishou 11), Hakodate City 
was established.
	 In 1939 (Shouwa 14), Hakodate City merged Yunokawa [\u6E6F
\u5DDD] Town (1st-class municipality). Yunokawa Town was located around 
Yunokawa Hot Spring. (See the note of Matsumae Town for 1st-class 
municipality.) 
	In 1966 (Shouwa 41), Hakodate City merged Zenigame-zawa [\u92AD
\u4E80\u6CA2] Village (the former 1st-class municipality). Zenigame-
zawa was located around Hakodate Airport. In 1973 (Shouwa 48), Hakodate 	City merged Kameda [\u4E80\u7530] City. #7
 	The city hall of Hakodate and the Port of Hakodate are located 
at the foot of Mt. Hakodate. National Route 5 and the Hakodate Main 
Line start from the port.
	Hakodate was the gateway to Hokkaidou from the late 19th 
century to the late 20th century. (It was the gateway to Japan in the 
late Edo era). Seikan train-ferries (Seikan-renraku-sen) connected 
Hakodate and Aomori. The name ``Sei-kan'' is an abbreviation of Aomori 
and Hakodate in Kanji characters. #8
	Hakodate's population peaked in 1980 at 345,165 (including 
municipalities of Toi, Esan, Minami-kayabe, and Todohokke). The 
population decreased because (1) the end of pelagic fishing (deep-sea 
fishing), (2) opening of the Seikan Tunnel, (3) an increase in air 
travelers, and (4) motorization. #9
	Distinctive industries in Hakodate are sightseeing, fishery, 
fish processing, trade, and ship-building. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = 
potatoes 393 hectares in 2015, pasture 260, paddy rice 73, cabbage 54, 
beans (adzuki beans 19, soybeans 9, other beans 1), fodder 27,

	As for sightseeing, famous tourist sites are Goryoukaku [go-
ryou-kaku] Castle, Mt. Hakodate, night view from Mt. Hakodate, old 
Western-style buildings, old churches in Motomachi district, brick 
warehouses on an old wharf, Ekini market, Yunokawa Hot Spring, and 
landscape of slopes (saka-michi) filmed in movies and TV dramas. #11
	Goryoukaku [go-ryou-kaku] Castle was built inland to avoid 
artillery from foreign ships. The Tokugawa Shogunate singed the Japan-
US Treaty of Peace and Amity in 1854, then constructed the castle 
between 1857 and 1866. Goryoukaku became the last castle of the 
Tokugawa Shogunate forces. It fell during the Boshin War.
	Today, tourists enjoy climbing up an observation tower in 
front of the castle. The hight of the tower is 100 meters. The name 
``Goryoukaku'' is Japanese. It means five points fort. The shape can be 
seen from the tower. (Cannons could be placed at the points).
	In Hakodate, the Western-style buildings from the Meiji period 
has been preserved, for example, Hokkaidou Government Hakodate Branch 
Office and Hakodate Ward Public Hall. They were constructed after the 
great fires in the Meiji period. #12
	At Ekini market, tourists enjoy fishing for squid. The market 
used to be a morning fair in front of Hakodate Station. #13
  
#1  Mt. Hakodate is also called Gagyuu-san in Japanese. It means 
``lying-cow mountain.'' The shape of the mountain resembles a lying 
cow. The top of Mt. Hakodate was removed by 14 meters when guns were 
built in the Meiji period.
	Mt. Hakodate was a military base from the Meiji period to the 
Shouwa period (before Wold War II). Some peope say that the nature of 
the mountain remains because only military personnel entered.
	However, after a fort (so-called Hako-date) was built in the 
15th century, native trees on Mt. Hakodate were cut down for firewood 
and construction materials. 
	Today, cedar trees can be seen along the tourist road of Mt. 
Hakodate. Buses go on the road and a ropeway runs above it. The ceder 
trees have been cultivated since the Edo era (about 200 years ago). 
	The night view from Mt. Hakodate is counted as one of the World 
Top Three Night Views, along with Hong Kong and Naples. Sometimes, 
Nagasaki is counted as the top three instead of Hakodate. Nagasaki is 
also a port city.
	Those top-three rankings were counted by Japanese people. In 
the past, they traveled all over the world by ship. Japan was a 
maritime nation. (See Kushiro City in Kushiro sub-prefecture for World 
Top Three Sunset.)

#2  Mt. Hakodate is a mountain and a land-tied island. The city hall 
of Hakodate is located on a sandbar. The sandbar that links a land-tied 
island is called ``tombolo'' in geography. In the Meiji period, the 
central business district (CBD) of Hakodate was located on tombolo.
	Since then, the CBD extended inland; to the front of Hakodate 
Station in the Shouwa period, and to the front of Goryoukaku [Go-ryou-
kaku] Castle in the Heisei period. When I visited Hakodate in 2013, I 
saw many ``For Rent'' signs on the second floor of buildings near 
Hakodate Station. 

#3  The Tsugaru Strait has two necks. (A neck is a narrow part of the 
sea). The east neck is located between the Kameda Peninsula in Hakodate 
City and the Shimokita Peninsula in Aomori Prefecture.
	The west neck is located between the Matsumae Peninsula in 
Matsumae Town and the Tsugaru Peninsula in Aomori Prefecture. The 
Seikan Tunnel was constructed under the west neck. (See Matsumae Town 
in Oshima sub-prefecture for Tsugaru Strait; See Fukushima Town in 
Oshima sub-prefecture for the Seikan undersea tunnel.)
 
#4  The former Toi [\u6238\u4E95] Town (now Hakodate City) was located 
in the south end of the Kameda Peninsula. The name ``Toi'' is derived 
from ``toi-o-i'' in Ainu language. It means ``edible soil, exist, 
place.'' It signified diatomite (``keisoudo'' in Japanese).
	In the Edo era, Toi was already a village. The name was 
recorded in Matsumae-tou-gou-chou (Matsumae island gazetteer) [\u677E
\u524D\u5CF6\u90F7\u5E33], which was published in the Tenpou period 
(1831-1845) in the Edo era. After the Meiji period, in 1879 (Meiji 12), 
the administrative office (kochou-yakuba) of Toi village was 
established.
	In 1902 (Meiji 35), Toi Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established. In 1919 (Taishou 8), Toi Village (1st-class municipality) 
was established. In 1968 (Shouwa 43), Toi Town was established. (See 
the note of Matsumae Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.)
	On the other side of Toi, across the Tsugaru Strait, is Ooma 
Town (Aomori Prefecture). Ooma is famous for Ooma tuna. The same tuna 
is caught in Toi. The price of Toi tuna is less expensive than Ooma 
tuna. (I heard this in the 2010s.)
	The taste of tuna caught in the Tsugaru Strait is good, because 
they eat flying squid. Tuna are warm-water fish and has been caught in 
Hokkaidou since the 1990s.
	* * *
 	The former Minami-kayabe [\u5357\u8305\u90E8] Town (now 
Hakodate City) is located to the east of the Kameda Peninsula. (See 
Mori Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the name ``Kayabe.'')
	In 1879 (Meiji 12), the administrative office (kochou-yakuba) 
of Osatsube [\u5C3E\u672D\u90E8] village was established. In 1880 
(Meiji 13), an administrative office was established in Usujiri [\u81FC
\u5C3B] village. Those villages had continued from the Edo era.
	In 1906 (Meiji 39), Osatsube Village (2nd-class municipality) 
and Usujiri Village (2nd-class municipality) were established. In 1959 
(Shouwa 39), Minami-kayabe Town was established by the merger of 
Osatsube and Usujiri.
	In 1975, a hollow clay figurine was dug from a potato field in 
Minami-kayambe Town. It is the only national treasure in Hokkaidou. 
Previously, Matsumae Castle (Fukuyama Castle) was counted as a national 
treasure, however, it was burned down. (See Matsumae Town in Oshima 
sub-prefecture for the castle.)
	* * *
	The former Esan [\u6075\u5C71] Town (now Hakodate City) is 
located in the east end of the Kameda Peninsula. The area faces the 
Tsugaru Strait.
	The name ``Esan'' comes from ``e-san-i'' in Ainu language. It 
means ``head, stick out, place.'' It signified Mt. Esan (618 meters). 
Mt. Esan is an active volcano. The bare soil stands out from the 
Pacific Ocean.
	In the the Edo era, Shirikishinai [\u5C3B\u5CB8\u5185] village 
was established. After the Meiji period, in 1872 (Meiji 5), the 
administrative office (kochou-yakuba) of Shirikishinai village was 
established. It was a continuation of village chief system from the Edo 
era.
	In 1879 (Meiji 12), the administrative office of Shirikishinai 
village was re-established. In 1906 (Meiji 39), Shirikishinai Village 
(2nd-class municipality) was established. In 1964 (Shouwa 39), 
Shirikishinai Town was established. In 1985 (Shouwa 60), the name was 
changed to Esan. It was named after Mt. Esan.
	* * *
	The former Todohokke [\u6934\u6CD5\u83EF] Village in Hakodate 
City is also located in the east end of the Kameda Peninsula. It was 
the smallest municipality in Hokkaidou (25 square kilometers, as same 
as Atsubetsu Ward in Sapporo).
	The name ``Todohokke'' comes from ``tu-pok-ke'' in Ainu 
language. It means ``mountain foot, under, place.'' It signified the 
mountain foot of Mt. Esan.
	In the Edo era, Todohokke was included in Osatsube village. 
After the Meiji period, in 1880 (Meiji 13), the administrative office 
of Todohokke village was established. In 1919 (Taishou 8), it became 
Todohokke Village (2nd-class municipality).

#5  The Port of Hakodate was a natural port. Japanese people called it 
tsuna-shirazu (rope, no need). They also called it Tomoe Port (spiral
 port) due to the spiral-like topography.
	The Japan-US Treaty of Peace and Amity (Nichi-bei-washin-
jouyaku) was concluded in 1854 between the Tokugawa Shogunate and the 
United States. Then, the Port of Hakodate and the Port of Shimoda were 
opened. (Shimoda is located in the Izu Peninsula, Shizuoka Prefecture).
	Japanese isolation policy was ended due to the effort 
(pressure) of Matthew Perry, who was the commander of the East India 
Squadron in the United States.
	 On his black steamships (kuro-fune), Mattew Perry appeared in 
many ports in Japan after 1853. Japanese people were surprised at the 
black ships. They moved by steam engine. (Old sail ships were moved by 
the wind). The fllagship was Susquehanna. (See Takikawa City in Sorachi
sub-prefecture for steamrs.)
	In 1859, the Treaty of Amity and Commerce (Nichi-bei-syuukou-
tsuushou-jouyaku) was concluded between the Tokugawa Shogunate and the 
United States. Then, Along with Hakodate, the ports of Kanagawa 
(Yokohama), Nagasaki, Hyougo (Koube), and Niigata were opened. (Shimoda 
was closed instead of Kanagawa).
	Foreign settlements were built near the ports. Cities of Edo 
(now the center of Tokyo) and Oosaka were opened for foreign visitors.

#6  The Boshin War was a civil war between the new Meiji government 
forces and the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces. The final phase of the 
war is called the Hakodate War. (See Kikonai, Matsumae, Mori towns in 
Oshima sub-prefecture, Assabu, Esashi, and Otobe towns in Hiyama sub-
prefecture for the Boshin War.)
	The commander of the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces was 
Takeaki Enomoto. He learned English from John Manjirou and studied in 
the Netherlands. After the defeat in the Boshin War, Takeaki Enomoto 
was appointed by Kiyotaka Kuroda and worked for the Hokkaidou 
Development Commission with Kuroda.
	(Kiyotaka Kuroda was an officer of the Meiji government forces 
and was the undersecretary [vice miiister] of the Hokkaidou 
Development Commission. He invited American advisors come to 
Hokkaidou.) 
	Toshizou Hijikata was an officer of the former Tokugawa 
Shogunate forces. He was killed in the Hakodate War. In the Edo era, 
he was the vice-commander of Shinsen-gumi, which was the special forces 
of the Tokugawa Shogunate.
	* * *
	Shinpachi Nagakura was the strongest swordsman among the 
members of Shinsen-gumi. Near the main gate of Hokkaidou University, 
there is a small plaque to him. He was born and raised in the Edo 
branch of the Matsumae Domain. (Edo was the center of today's Tokyo; 
The Matsumae Domain ruled today's Hokkaidou during the Edo era).
	 Shinpachi Nagakura learned swordmanship in Edo and fled from 
the Matsumae Domain. After Shinsen-gumi was abolished, he participated 
in the Boshin War, however, not the Hakodate War. At the time, he was a 
member of the Tokugawa Shogunate forces. If he had participated in the 
Hakodate War, he would have to fight against his former monarch.
	In the Meiji period, Shinpachi Nagakura taught swordsmanship at 
Kabato Prison and Agricultural Collage of Touhoku Imperial University 
(now Hokkaidou University). To the swordsman, swords seemed to stand 
still. (See Tsukigata Town in Sorchi sub-prefecture for Kabato prison.)

#7  As for the former Kameda City (now Hakodate City), the name ``Kame-
da'' is Japanese. It means ``turtle, rice field.'' It is a good-luck 
name as well as Chitose City in Ishikari sub-prefecture.
	The name ``Chitose'' is Japanese. It means ``one thousand 
years.'' It implies cranes. According to an old Chinese legend, cranes 
(tsuru) live 1,000 years and turtles (kame) live 10,000 years.
	In the early 17th century, the Matsumae Domain built a 
guardhouse (bansho) in Kameda. It was moved to Hakodate in the 18th 
century. After the Meiji period, from 1879 (Meiji 12) to 1881 (Meiji 
14), seven administrative offices for 25 villages were established in 
Kameda county [\u4E80\u7530\u90E1];
	 (1) Shinori [\u5FD7\u82D4], Zenigame-zawa; (2) Kami-yukawa 
[\u4E0A\u6E6F\u5DDD], Shimo-yukawa [\u4E0B\u6E6F\u5DDD], Kameo [\u4E80
\u5C3E]; (3) Ishizaki [\u77F3\u5D0E]; (4) Akagawa [\u8D64\u5DDD], 
Oonakayama, Kikyou [\u6854\u6897], Ishikawa [\u77F3\u5DDD]; 
	(continued) --> (5) Nanae, Ikusagawa [\u8ECD\u5DDD], Shiroyama 
[\u57CE\u5C71], Fujiyama [\u85E4\u5C71], Tougue-shita [\u5CE0
\u4E0B], Tsuruno [\u9DB4\u91CE]; 
	(continued) --> (6) Ippongui [\u4E00\u672C\u6728], Chiyoda 
[\u5343\u4EE3\u7530], Fumizuki [\u6587\u6708], Ichino-watari [\u5E02
\u6E21], Oono, Hongou [\u672C\u90F7]; (7) Kameda, Kaji [\u935B\u51B6], 
and Kamiyama [u795E\u5C71]).
	In 1902 (Meiji 23), Kameda Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established. At the time, the villages of Kameda, Kamiyama, Kaji, 
Kikyou, and Ishikawa were merged. In 1919 (Taishou 8), Kameda Village 
(1st-class municipality) was established. (See the note of Matsumae 
Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.) 
	In 1962 (Shouwa 37), Kameda Town was established. In 1971 
(Shouwa 46), Kameda City was established. In 1973 (Shouwa 48), Kameda 
City was merged by Hakodate City. Kameda City existed only for two 
years and one month. (Fushimi City in Kyouto Prefecture existed only 
for one year and eleven months.)
	The former Kameda City is located in the west of Hakodate City. 
The area includes Goryoukaku [go-ryou-kaku] Station and Kikyou Station 
on the Hakodate Main Line. The address of Goryoukaku Station is Kameda-
honchou. The name is Japanese and means ``Kameda main town.''

#8  Seikan train-ferries operated from 1908 (Meiji 41) to 1988 (Shouwa 
63). In September 1954, the ferry Touya-maru was sunk in the Touya-maru 
Typhoon (Typhoon Marie). 1,155 people died and plans for the Seikan 
undersea tunnel moved forward. (See Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-
prefecture for the Seikan Tunnel.)
	There is a famous song called Tsugaru-kaikyou-fuyu-geshiki 
(Tsugaru Strait winter scene). The lyrics are like this; ``People who 
return to the north island are quiet. They only hear the sound of the 
sea.''
	The following was my sales pitch to invite master students ``It 
is a good thing to live in north island for two years. Cities in 
Honshuu island are too hot.''
	Travelers from Honshuu island would think that Hakodate and 
Sapporo are close because they are in the same prefecture. However, it 
takes 4 hours by express train, 4 hours by expressway, and 5.5 hours by 
bus. The route goes around the bay (Volcano Bay).

#9  The Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ, a 200 nautical mile zone) was 
activated in the 1980s. It ended North Ocean Fishing (deep-sea 
fishing). In the past, the ports of Hakodate, Kushiro, and Nemuro were 
the bases of North Ocean Fishing. (Other ports for North Ocean Fishing 
were Otaru, Rumoi, Wakkanai, Monbetsu, Abashiri, and Furubira.)
	Groups of ships departed the ports to catch salmon near Russian 
and US Alaskan waters. Hakodate was a base for mother-ship (bosen) type 
fishing. Kushiro and Nemuro were bases for mother-port (bokou) type 
fishing. The mother-ship equipped a factory to make canned salmon.
	Incidentally, there is ``mother'' in the word ``sea'' in 
French (``mer'' and ``mere [m\u00E8re]'') and in Japanese (``haha 
[\u6BCD]'' and ``umi [\u6D77]'').

#10  As for trade in Hakodate City, the main importing countries are 
Russia (coal, fish), China (fish), and South Korea (petroleum 
products). The main exporting country is Panama (flag-of-convenience 
ships) in 2011 by Hakodate Customs. The coal from Russia is used in the 
cement industry in Hokuto City.
	As for ship-building, Hakodate Dock makes bulk carriers, cement 
carriers, and fishing boats. As for fishery, squid are caught near the 
coast from June to December. Fishing lights float on the sea. The scene
is fantasical. 

#11  The landscape of slopes are famous in port cities, such as 
Hakodate, Nagasaki, San Francisco, and Rio de Janeiro. Slopes in 
Hakodate are straight and lead to the sea. The landscape is unique 
because Japan is a mountainous country and roads curve along the 
contours. (See Yuni Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for straight roads.)

#12  The center of Hakodate suffered many fires. Large fires occurred 
in 1879 (Meiji 12), 1899 (Meiji 32), 1907 (Meiji 40), 1934 (Shouwa 9), 
and 1945 (Shouwa 25, air raids). There is a buffer zone near the city 
hall, where Tochi-no-ki (horse chestnut, marronnier) were planted.
	In Honshuu island, people say ``Mochi-no-ki (bird-lime holly, 
a kind of forever-green broad-leaved tree) prevents the spread of 
fire.''

#13  I visited Hakodate on excursions in May 2013 and May 2017. In both 
years, a Toshizou Hijikata Look-alike Contest was held at Goryoukaku 
[go-ryou-kaku] Castle. The 2017 winner was a woman. Toshizou Hijikawa 
was the commander of the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces. He dead in 
Hakodate at the end of the Boshin War. 
	As for the tram in Hakodate, a very old car runs with a ticket 
seller on board. A red car also run. It is said that if you see the 
red tram, you will be happy. (It is a Coca-cola advertising car.)
	The tram's last stop is Yunokawa Hot Spring. It is Oku-zashiki 
(so-called an inner parlor) of Hakodate. The hot spring was opened by 
the Matsumae Domain in 1653. In the hot spring area, there was a nice 
and inexpensive hotel that we stayed during excursions. Nowadays, it is 
difficult to stay at the hotel, because it became popular with foreign 
tourists.
	Local foods of Hakodate include Lucky Pierrot hamburgers, 
Madalena cookies of Trappistine Monastery, curry and rice, and grilled-
chicken lunch-box of Hasegawa Store. The restaurant Gotouken opened in 
the Meiji period. It became popular for its curry and rice. Nowadays, 
tourists enjoy curry and rice even in the morning at hotel buffets.
	Curry was brought to Japan via the British Navy. The original 
place of curry and rice is India. It was the vassal state of the 
British Empire. The former navy cities in Japan such as Hakodate and 
Yokosuka appeal their curry and rice.
	Indian curry is like a soup. Japanese curry is like a sauce, 
therefore, navy crews could eat it on moving battle ships. In 
Hokkaidou, curry was introduced not only in Hakodate but also in 
Sappro. Curry and rice were served for American teachers and Japanese 
students at Sapporo Agricultural College. (See Kita Ward in Sapporo 
City for curry and rice in Sapporo Agricultural College.)
	Curry is basically soup. If a family serves curry and miso soup
(soybean paste soup) at the dinner, the family retains an old custom. 
Curry and rice has been eaten by Japanese people for long. In the past, 
every farmer had many children. They were hungry and loved curry.
Miso soup was cooked so that all family members could eat curry.
	* * *
	As for Lucky Pierrot hamburgers, I heard these; ``It is popular 
than McDonald in Hakodate,'' ``They serve whale hamburgers,'' ``The 
hamburgers are large,'' ``The shops are located near high schools.''
Local foods in port cities are hearty and delicious. (See Kushiro City 
in Kushiro sub-prefecture and Nemuro City in Nemuro sub-prefecture for 
port cities' foods.)

Nanae [na-na-e] [\u4E03\u98EF] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, 
south Hokkaidou (dou-nan). It is an inland town. The Kunebetsu River 
flows south and empties into Hakodate Bay.
	Mt. Komagatake (1,131 meters, volcano) rises to the north. Lake 
Oonuma is located at the foot of Mt. Komagatake. The lake and the 
mountain are designated as Oonuma Quasi National Park (Oonuma-kokutei-
kouen).
	The name ``Nanae'' comes from ``naa-nay'' in Ainu language, 
which means ``many, stream.'' Or, it comes from ``nam-nay'' in Ainu 
language, which means ``cold, stream.'' Both signified Nanae-hama beach 
along Hakodate Bay. (The beach belongs to Hokuto City now.)
	Before the Edo era, Mishima Shrine was built in 1532. (When a 
Japanese village was established, a shrine was established too (Nihei 
lab, 2023).) In the Edo era (from the 17th centry to the 19th century), 
Nanae [\u4E03\u91CD] was a Japanese village ruled by the Matsumae 
Domain.
	After the Meiji period, in 1870 (Meiji 3), Nanae Kan-en (a 
government farm) was built by the Hokkaidou Development Commission. An 
American advisor Edwin Dun instructed Western-style farming at the 
government farm, including dairy farming and butter production. #1
 	In 1879 (Meiji 12), the administrative office (kochou-yakuba) 
of Nanae [\u4E03\u98EF] village was established by the merger of Nanae 
and Iida [\u98EF\u7530] villages. The administrative office of 
Oonakayama [\u5927\u4E2D\u5C71] village was established by the merger 
of Ookawa [\u5927\u5DDD] and Nakajima [\u4E2D\u5CF6] villages.
 	In 1885 (Meiji 18), Nanae village merged Oonakayama's village.  
In 1902 (Meiji 35), Nanae Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established. Nanae Station on Hokkaidou Railway (now Hakodate Main 
Line) opened. 
	In 1907 (Meiji 40), Nanae Village (1st-class municipality) was 
established. In 1957 (Shouwa 32), Nanae Town was established. (See the 
note of Matsumae Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.) #2
  	The town hall of Nanae and the center of the town are located 
on the south of the Hakodate Plain. The part is also called Oono Plain. 
National Route 5 (Oonuma-kokudou) and the Hakodate Main Line run 
through the plain. The row of red pine trees (Akamatsu-namiki) along 
National Route 5 is designated as one of the 100 Roads of Japan. #3 #4 
#5
	The south part of Nanae Town, including Oonakayama Station, is 
a built-up area that continues from Hakodate City. The population 
increased. Nanae is the second largest town (machi) in Hokkaidou after 
Otofuke Town in Tokachi sub-prefecture.
 	Distinctive industries in Nanae are manufacturing, agriculture, 
dairy farming, and sightseeing. The main manufacturing products are

	As for sightseeing, Oonuma has been designated as the New 
Three Scenic Views of Japan. Niyama Ski Ground is located next to 
Niyama Station. #7 #8 #9
  
#1  As for Nanae Governmental Farm, in 1863, near the end of the Edo 
era, the Gaertner brothers rented the land and started Western-style 
farming. They came from Prussia (now Germany). The area of Gaertner's 
farm was 990 hectares. (Cf. Hokkaidou University Ranch is 470 hectares, 
see Shin-hidaka Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture for the universty ranch.) 
	The main duties of the Gaertner brothers were trade and 
consulship. Besides these, they started to cultivate apples, pears, 
gooseberries, cherries, and vegetables. The apples were the first 
Western varieties cultivated in Japan. The brothers taught Western-
style farming to neighboring farmers.
	The Gaertner brothers sold food to foreign ships in the Port of 
Hakodate, which opened in 1854. There are no photographs and paintings 
of the brothers. Their appearances are unknown. 
 	The Gaertner brothers also planted beech trees. They became a 
forest along National Route 5. Beech forests were used for grazing pigs 
in Prussisa (Germany). The meat of the wild boars that ate acorns is 
good.
 	In 1870 (Meiji 3), the Gaertner brothers' farm was closed. On 
the site, Nanae Government Farm (Nanae-kan-en) opened. The Meiji 
government bought the land back.
	To introduce Western-style farming to Hokkaidou, the new Meiji 
government established five experiment farms in Tokyo and Hokkaidou. In 
Tokyo, there were Aoyama and Azabu farms. In Hokkaidou, there were 
Nanae, Sapporo, and Nemuro farms. Nanae was the largest
	An English writer Isabella Lucy Bird visited the government 
farm in 1878. She reported the scenery like this; ``The farm was like a 
Western country. It had Western-style buildings such as animal stables, 
a large watermill, and a butter factory.'' (See Mori Town in Oshima 
sub-prefecture for the English writer). 
	In 1882, the Hokkaidou Development Commission was abolished. 
After that, Nanae Government Farm was gradually sold off and closed in 
1894. Only its stone wall remains near Nanae Elementary School.

#2  Nanae Town belongs to Kameda county. The name ``Kame-da'' is 
Japanese. It means ``turtle, paddy field.'' It is a good-luck name. 
(See the note of Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the name 
``Kameda''.)

#3  Mt. Nanae (779 meters) rises near the center of the town. The night 
view of Hakodate from the mountain is called Hakodate-ura-yakei 
(another side of Hakodate night view).

#4  Oonuma Station on the Hakodate Main Line is a junction of Oonuma 
main route and Sawara branch route. (See Mori Town in Oshima sub-
prefecture for Sawara branch route.)
	 There is another branch route between Oonuma Station and Nanae 
Station. Japanese National Railways built the branch route in 1966 for 
increasing transport capacity. It was before motorization. (See Otobe 
town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for motorization.)

#5  The large red pine trees [aka-matsu] along National Route 5 are 
reminiscent of old trails in Honshuu island. In 1876 (Meiji 9), the 
trees were transplanted from Goryoukaku [go-ryou-kaku] Castle to the 
roadside.
	 The purpose of the transplantation was to create a scenic road 
before Emperor Meiji visited Nanae Government Farm. (See Uryuu Town in 
Sorachi sub-prefecture for red pine trees.

#6  Guarana [Guaran\u00E1] is a popular drink in Brazil. It is like 
Coca-cola of Brazil. Guarana is made from the red berries of Guarana 
tree. Guarana tree is native to the Amazon region. It is a tree of 
tropic rain forest.
	After World War II, Coca-cola became popular in Honshuu island. 
Before the American product landed in Hokkaidou island, a company in 
Nanane started to sell Guarana. It is still popular in Hokkaidou. When 
I saw a student drinking a can of Guarana during a course, I told this 
story;
	``Japanese people pronounce Guarana as `ga-ra-na.' It is like 
English. In Brazil, the original place of Guarana, people pronounce it 
`gu-a-ra-na.' It is like Latin.
	When I ordered Guarana in a jet plane in Brazil, I said `Ah, 
ga-ra-na.' Then, the stewardess gave me a bottle of water. It may have 
sounded `Agua, ne?' [\u00C1gua, n\u00E9?] (Water, OK?).'' (See Hakodate 
City in Oshima sub-prefecture for local foods.)

#7  These are the New Three Scenic Views of Japan; Mihono-matsubara in 
Shizuoka Prefecture (Honshuu island), Yabakei in Ooita Prefecture 
(Kyuushuu island), and Oonuma in Hokkaidou Prefecture (Hokkaidou 
island). Those were designated in 1915 (Taishou 4).
	 (They are not new. Japanese people like putting ``new'' to 
things. They also like ``top-three things.'')
	The original Three Scenic Views are located in Honshuu island. 
They are Matsushima in Miyagui Prefecture (Pacific Ocean), Amano-
hashidate in Kyouto Prefecture (the Sea of Japan), and Itsukushima in 
Hiroshima Prefecture (the Seto Inland Sea).
	 The original Three Scenic Views were selected in 1643, during 
the Edo era. At the time, the Tokugawa Shogunate ruled the country and 
ordinary people could not travel freely.

#8  Oonuma Quasi National Park includes Lake Oonuma, Lake Konuma, and 
Lake Junsai. The shapes of the lakes were formed by the eruption of Mt. 
Komagatake in 1640.
	In Lake Oonuma, sweet fish and shrimp are caught. In Lake 
Junsai, Junsai (buds of watershield) can be harvested. Junsai is tasty 
in Dashi soup. (My wife does not eat it, saying, ``It is like nasal 
mucus.'')
	In the end of the Edo era, Lake Oonuma was opened to foreigners 
for walking. In the Meiji period, an ice factory was built on the shore 
of Lake Oonuma. The factory cut ice cubes from the lake in winter, 
stored them, and shipped them from Hakodate to Tokyo in summer (by 
Professor Katsuhiko Yamashita at the Meeting of Hokkaidou Geographical 
Society in 2014).
	The story of ice factory reminds me of the etymology of Nanae.
It means ``cold stream.'' Ice was very expensive in the past. After 
the 1960s, villas were developed on the slope from Lake Oonuma to Mt. 
Komagatake. Aerial photographs show roundabouts (rotaries) and ``culs 
de sac'' in the area. (See Otaru City in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for 
roundabouts.) 
	* * *
	The famous song ``Sen-no-kaze-ni-natte (Be a thousand winds)'' 
was translated by a composer at his villa in Oonuma. The original work
is an American poem ``Do not stand at my grave and weep.'' (If I became 
a ghost, I would not be in my grave. I would go to Daimaru department 
store and watch people.)

#9  This is a legend about Lake Oonuma and Mt. Komagatake; ``Masatane 
Aihara was the load of Fort Oodate in the 15th century. The fort was 
located in what is now Matsumae Town. Masatane Aihara came to Ezo 
island (old Hokkaidou) with Masasue Andou, Kakizaki Sueshige, and 
Nobuhiro Takeda.
	Masatne Andou was the leader of them. He built 12 forts in Ezo 
island and returned the main island. Nobuhiro Takeda, who ended 
Koshamain's war, inherited the Kakizaki clan and started to rule 
Ezo island.
	Masatane Aihara came into conflict with the Kakizaki clan. 
Masatane Aihara was defeated and fled to Lake Oonuma. He drowned 
himself into the lake. Later, the Kakizaki clan became the lord of the 
Matsumae Domain in the Edo era (from the 17th to the 19th centuries).
	Even in the Edo era, Masatane Aihara's horse was seen several 
times near Lake Oonuma. The horse had a very long mane that reached on 
the ground.''
	This is a legend. Masatane Aihara may have died during 
Koshamain's War. The legend says that the name of Mt. Komagatake 
signifies the Masatane Aihara's ghost horse. Mt. Koma-ga-take means 
``horse, of, mountain'' in Japanese. It is generally said that the 
shape of the mountain looks like a horse.
	* * *
	The legend of Aihara is similar to the legend of Yoshitsune 
Minamoto. He was killed by his elder brother Yoshitune Minamoto, who 
established the Kamakura Shogunate. Japanese people feel sympathy for 
tragic heroes.
	The sympathy is called Hangan-biiki (or Hougan-biiki) in 
Japanese. ``Hangan'' means the job position of Yoshitsune Minamoto and 
``biiki'' means sympathy.
	(See Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the old 12 
established by the Andou clan; See Biratori Town in Hidaka sub-
prefecture for Yoshitsune legend; See Niikappu Town in Hidaka sub-
prefecture for Hangan-date Rock.)

Shikabe [shi-ka-be] [\u9E7F\u90E8] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, 
south Hokkaidou (dou-nan). The rivers of Honbetsu, Shikabe, Orito, and 
Tokoro flow to the Pacific Ocean. The Orito River flows from Lake 
Oonuma in Oonuma Quasi National Park.
	Mt. Komagatake (1,131 meters, volcano) stands to the north. It 
erupted in 1929. A large amount of pumice piled up. (See Nanae Town in 
Oshima sub-prefecture for lake Oonuma and Mt. Komagatake.)
	The name ``Shikabe'' comes from ``sikerpe'' in Ainu language. 
It means ``Amur cork tree (`Kihada' in Japanese).'' Or, it comes from 
``sike-un-pe'' in Ainu language, which means ``carry, it, place.'' 
The latter means a place where Ainu people got off their boats and 
carry their luggage. Both signified the mouth of the Shikabe River. #1
	In 1666, during the Edo era, a hot spring was discovered by 
Guen-gorou Itou, who came from Tsugaru (now Aomori Prefecture). He 
found a deer (shika) that healed its wounds in the hot spring. It is 
the origin of Shikabe Hot Spring. In the Edo era, fishermen emigrated.
	After the Meiji period, in 1879 (Meiji 12), the administrative 
office (kochou-yakuba) of Shikabe village was established. In 1906 
(Meiji 39), Shikabe Village (2nd-class municipality) was established. 
In 1983 (Shouwa 58), Shikabe Town was established. (See the note of 
Matsumae Town for 2nd-class municipality.) 
	The town hall of Shikabe and the center of the town are located 
near the mouth of the Shikabe River. National Route 278 (Esan-kokudou) 
runs there. At the foot of Mt. Komagatake, the Sawara branch route of 
the Hakodate Main Line runs. Running along the Pacific coast, it 
detours the slope of Mt. Komagatake. 
	Distinctive industries in Shikabe are fishery and tourism. 
STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = pasture 52 hectares in 2015 and fodder 16; 
dairy cows - (zero) head in 2015. STATISTICS OF FISHERIES = walleye 
pollock 4,165 tons in 2017, sardines 701, octopus 401, shellfish 327 
(including scallops), mackerel 146,

flounder 4, shrimp/prawns 4, herring 4, Kichiji 4, sea trout 3, horse 
mackerel 2, other fish 108+X (concealed), and other marine animals 62.
 	Fishing ports are located in Shikabe, Honbetsu, and Dekima 
districts. As for sightseeing, vacation homes, golf courses, and a 
resort hotel are located near Shikabe Station. (The station is far from 
the center of the town.)
	Shikabe Roadside Station is located on National Route 278. 
There is a geyser that gushes hot water up to 15 meters. It is a part 
of Shikabe Hot Spring. #2
  
#1  As for the name ``Shikabe'' (Amur cork tree in Ainu language), Amur 
cork tree was used as a yellow dye and an intestinal medicine. Amur 
cork tree is called ``Ki-hada'' in Japanese. It means ``yellow, skin.''
	Large Amur cork trees grow at the central lawn of Hokkaidou 
University. In 2018, during Typhoon No. 21, large branches were fell 
down. The yellow color of the bark stood out.
	Ainu people made ritual sticks (inau) from branches of these 
trees; Kihada, Yanagi (willow), Mizuki (dogwood), and Enju (pagoda 
tree). Ainu people believed those trees have good spirits.
	Ainu's ritual sticks are to be found in Hokkaidou University. 
The location is the Forest of Archaeological Site. Ainu's ritual sticks
look like dread hair. (See Abashiri City in Okhotsk sub-prefecture for 
Enju tree; See Biratori Town in Hidaka for Ainu culture.)
	Japanese people make ritual sticks from Sakaki (broad-leaved 
evergreen tree). (See Nihei lab (2023) for Sakaki tree.)

#2  As for Shiakbe Station, the former name was Takamachi Station. 
There used to be the original Shikabe Station on the Oonuma-dentetsu 
Line, which ran between 1929 and 1952, along the Orito River.
	The name ``Takamachi'' means ``hawk catcher'' in Japanese. 
There were hawk catchers in the Edo era. They caught hawks and falcons. 
(See Shiriuchi Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for falconry).

Mori [mo-ri] [\u68EE] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, south 
Hokkaidou (Dou-nan). The area faces Uchiura Bay (Volcano Bay). The 
rivers of Nigorikawa, Torizaki, and Oshironai flow. Mt. Komagatake 
(1,131 meters, volcano) rises to the south. The area was newly 
established by the merger of Mori Town and Sawara Town in 2005. #2
	The name ``Mori'' means ``forest (many trees)'' in Japanese. 
The original name was Oniushi, which comes from ``o-ni-us-pet'' in Ainu 
language. It means ``river mouth, tree, many, river.'' It signified the 
Torizaki River or the Mori River. (The pronunciation of Oni-ushi sounds 
like ``demon, ox'' in Japanese.)
	In the 16th century, the first Japanese immigrants came from 
Tsugaru (now Aomori Prefecture). In the Edo era, Kayabe-basho (a 
trading place) was established by the Matsumae Domain for herring 
fishing. Nigorikawa Hot Spring opened in 1805 in Nigorikawa Caldera. #3 
	Villages of Washinoki, Mori, and Oshironai were established in 
the Edo era. (See Yoichi Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for herring 
fishing.) The following is the history of Mori Town after the Meiji 
period;
	OLD MORI TOWN; In 1880 (Meiji 13), an administrative office 
(kochou-yakuba) was established in Washinoki [\u9DF2\u30CE\u6728] 
village. It covered villages of Ebiya [\u86EF\u8C37] and Ishikura 
[\u77F3\u5009]. In 1881 (Meiji 14), the administrative office of Mori 
village was established. It covered villages of Oshironai [\u5C3E\u767D
\u5185] and Shukunobe [\u5BBF\u91CE\u8FBA]. 
	In 1899 (Meiji 22), Mori village merged Washinoki village. The 
administrative office covered six villages (Mori, Oshironai, Shukunobe, 
Washinoki, Ebiya, and Ishikura). In 1902 (Meiji 35), Mori Village (2nd-
class municipality) was established. (See the note of Matsumae Town 
for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.) #4
	In 1903 (Meiji 36), Mori Station on Hokkaidou Railway (now 
Hakodate Main Line) opened. In 1907 (Meiji 40), Mori Village (1st-class 
municipality) was established. In 1921 (Taishou 10), Mori Town was 
established.
	OLD SAWARA TOWN; In 1880 (Meiji 13), the administrative office 
(kochou-yakuba) of Sawara [\u7802\u539F] village was established. It 
covered Kakeruma [\u639B\u6F97] village. In 1906 (Meiji 39), Sawara 
Village (2nd-class municipality) was established.
	In 1927 (Shouwa 2), Sawara Station on Oshima-kaigan-tetsudou 
(Oshima coastal railway) opened. (It became the current Sawara branch 
route of the Hakodate Main Line). In 1970 (Shouwa 45), Sawara Town was 
established.
	The town hall of Mori is located near the mouths of Torizaki 
and Mori rivers. National Route 278 (Esan-kokudou) branches off from 
National Route 5 (Oonuma-kokudou) near the town hall. National Route 278
runs along Uchiura Bay. #5
	Mori Station on the Hakodate Main Line is the junction of 
Oonuma main route and Sawara branch route. Heavy freight [fu-rei'-t] 
trains go the branch route along the bay. #6
	Distinctive industries in Mori are fishery, agriculture, animal 
husbandry, food processing, and geothermal power generation. STATISTICS 
OF AGRICUTURE = pasture 471 hectares in 2015, beans (soybeans 184, 
adzuki beans 101, other beans 15), potatoes 225, paddy rice 207, sugar 
beets 119, wheat 69, radishes 50, fodder 42, broccoli 27, flowers 6,

	At Nigorikawa district in Mori Town, farmers cultivate Onsen 
Tomato (hot-spring tomatoes). The tomatoes are grown in the greenhouses 
being heated by hot spring water. (by K. Umeda 2007. Development and 
sustainability of vegetable farming in geothermal greenhouses http://
doi.org/10.4157/grj.80.225 ; See Biratori Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture 
for tomato production.)
	As for sightseeing, Mori Station is the birth place of Ika-
meshi (squid rice). Squid rice became famous all over the country for 
department stores' station-lunch festivals. #9

#1  Mori Town belongs to Kayabe county (Kayabe-gun). The name 
``Kayabe'' comes from ``kaya-un-pe'' in Ainu language. It means ``sail, 
exist, place.'' It signified Mt. Komagatake. Ainu people viewed the 
shape of the mountain as a sailing ship. (See Nanae Town in Oshima sub-
prefecture for Mt. Komagatake.)
	The Hazard Map of Komagatake Volcano was published in 1983. It 
was the first volcano hazard map in the country. The map included the 
towns of Mori, Shikabe, and Nanae. (Nowadays, each municipality 
publshes own hazard map.)
	Who makes hazard maps? The answer is consulting companies. They 
are the main employers of graduates of Faculty of Geology and Faculty 
of Geography (by K. Mannen 2020 ``Volcanoes as seen from cutting-edge 
science'' [written in Japanese]). Many of my classmates work for 
consulting companies.

#2  The pronunciation of ``Mori Town'' in Japanese is ``Mori-machi.'' 
Other towns in Hokkaidou are pronounced ``-chou,'' for example, 
Kayabe-chou and Yakumo-chou.
	The municipality decides the pronunciation. It is said that 
``-machi'' is located mainly in eastern Japan and ``-chou'' is located 
mainly in western Japan. According to the Chuunichi Shinbun (20210719), 
the town hall surveyed an old telegram from 1938 and an old gazetteer 
of Hokkaidou Government, and decided the name ``Mori-machi'' in 1987.
	(Cf. The former Ishikari 10 towns in Ishikari City were mixture 	of ``-machi'' and ``-chou.'' See Ishikari City in Ishikari sub-
prefecture.)
	The river name ``Torizaki'' is derived from ``torii (shrine 
gate)'' in Japanese. There was a shrine in the forest. It had many 
Torii gates. The place was called Torii-ga-saki (shrine gate, of, 
cape).
	On the map published by Takeshirou Matsuura in 1859 (http://
koukita.github.io/touzaiezo/map/), the river is written as Torisaki-
kawa (Torizaki River). The map was published in the Edo era. (See 
Setana Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for Japanese river names.)
 
#3  The first immigrants came to Sawara from Kanita (now Sotogahama 
Town in Aomori Prefecture) in 1532 (by ``Sawara-chou-shi [Sawara Town 
history)'' published in 2000).
	The former Sawara Town has a long history of Japanese 
immigrants, therefore, the origin of the name is unclear. These are 
estimations from the book Sawara-chou-shi;
	(1) The name ``Sawara'' comes from ``sar'' in Ainu language. It 
means ``reed.'' (2) The name comes from ``sarki'' in Ainu language. It 
means ``reed.'' (3) The name comes from ``sa-wara'' in Japanese. It 
means ``sandy, field.''

#4  In the beginning of the Meiji period, the former Tokugawa Shogunate 
forces landed on the coast of Washinoki. It was the beggining of the 
Hakodate War. (The Hakodate War was the final phase of the Boshin War.)
	The commanding officers of the Tokugawa Shogunate were Takeaki 
Enomoto and Toshizou Hijikata. They were aboard the battleships Kaiyou 
and Kaiten. Kaiyou was made in the Netherlands. Kaiten was made in 
Prussia (now Germany).
 	The landing took place on December 4th, 1868. A strong wind was 
blowing. The local wind is called Taba-kaze. (See Easahi Town in Hiyama 
sub-prefecture for local winds.)
	The battleship Kaiyou was sunk in Esashi. The battleship Kaiten 
was sunk in Hakodate. (See Esashi Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the 
battleship Kaiyou; See Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for 
Boshin War.)

#5  National Route 5 runs along a railway. It connects Hakodate and 
Sapporo. The road opened in 1873 (Meiji 6). At the time, the road was 
called Sapporo-hondou (Sapporo Main Road). The road crossed Uchiura Bay 
(Volcano Bay) from Mori to Muroran by boat.
	In 1878 (Meiji 11), the British writer Isabella Lucy Bird 
stayed at an inn in Mori. She was traveling from Hakodate to Biratori 
to see Ainu culture. She documented Mori like this, ``Mori is a large 
village in the south of Volcano Bay, however, the houses are about to 
collapse at any moment.''
	However, she liked the view from the inn. (See Nanae Town in 
Oshima sub-prefecture, Toyoura Town in Iburi sub-prefecture, and 
Biratori Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture for the writer.)

#6  The Sawara branch route of the Hakodate Main Line connects Mori 
Station and Oonuma Station via the former Shikabe Town. During World 
War II, the branch route was constructed to increase transportation 
capacity.
	It was constructed by utilizing two existing railroads; Oshima-
kaigan-tetsudou (Oshima Coastal Railway) and Oonuma-dentetsu (Oonuma 
Electric Railway). In June 1945, the branch route opened. In August 
1945, the war ended.

#7  As for animal husbandry in Mori, there are swine farms managed by 
NH Foods (Nippon Ham Foods). The company's processing plant is located 
in neighboring Yakumo Town. As for food processing, Nichirei Foods 
produces croquettes and minced cutlets. Maruha Nichiro produces salmon 
flakes and minced chicken.
	In the garden of Nichirei Foods, there is a monument that 
commemorates the birth place of frozen food in Japan. Nichirei Foods 
started frozen food business in 1920 (Taishou 9). The company made 
frozen fish using a charcoal gas engine and sold them in Tokyo. The 
freezing factory was constructed by American father-son engineers.
	Regarding frozen food, the first home refrigerator was sold by 
GE (General Electric) in the USA. It was in the 1920s. After the 1960s, 
Japanese companies produced a lot of refrigerators.
	My parents used a Hitachi refrigerator for 50 years. The next 
refrigerator was broken in two years. Nowadays, companies pursue 
profit. Never broken refrigerators are bad for them.

#8  As for power generation in Mori, Hokkaidou Electric Power (Hokuden) 
operates a geothermal power plant on the slope of Nigorikawa caldera. 
Geothermal power generation is suitable to the volcanic archipelago. 
There are no fuel costs.
	However, geothermal power gereration has disadvantages; (1) The 
output is small compared to the size of the building. (2) The cost of 
construction is high.(3) Because many volcanoes are located in national 
parks, nature conservation laws restrict the construction. 

#9  Abe Shouten (Abe Store) started to sell Ika-meshi (squid rice) at 
Mori Station in 1941. It was during World War II. All trains stopped at 
Mori Station because it was the junction of the Hakodate Main Line and 
the Oshima Coastal Railway (Oshima-kaigan-tetsudou).
	Squid rice became popular among young soldiers who stationed in 
Hokkaidou. At the time, the catch of flying squid was good. In 
addition, squid rice can be cooked with a small amount of rice. During 
World War II, rice distribution was controlled.
	Nowadays, many companies sell their squid rice. The original 
Abe Store started selling vacuum packed squid rice in 2016. Souvenir 
shops at Sapporo Station and New Chitose Airport started selling the 
original squid rice. 
	Previously, the expiry date of the original squid rice was one 
day. Therefore, it was sold through demonstration sales at department 
stores. Incidentally, squid-shaped potteries of 4000-year-old were 
excavated in Mori Town in 2002. 
	* * *
	There used to be many department stores in front of large 
stations. Department stores also did out-of-store sales (gaishou). 
Nowadays, large shopping malls stand in the former paddy fields.
	Your grand mother may remember her shopping at department 
stores and may serve you squid rice when you visit her house.

Yakumo [ya-ku-mo] [\u516B\u96F2] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, 
south Hokkaidou (dou-nan). The area crosses the narrow part of Oshima 
Peninsula. It faces Uchiura Bay (Funka-wan) and the Sea of Japan. The 
name ``Funka-wan'' is a translation of Volcano Bay into Japanese. (See 
Oshima sub-prefecture for the bay).
 	The area was newly formed by the merger of Yakumo Town and 
Kumaishi Town in 2005. The former Yakumo Town was located along Uchiura 
Bay on the Pacific Ocean side. The former Kumaishi Town was located 
along the Sea of Japan. With the merger, Futami county was newly 
established. The name ``Futami'' is Japanese, which means ``two seas.''
	The name ``Yakumo'' is Japanese, which means ``overlapping 
clouds.'' It was named by Yoshikatsu Tokugawa, who was the founder of 
Tokugawa Farm. He quoted the name from the oldest poem. (Tokugawa Farm 
was the birthplace of Hokkaidou's famous souvenirs; butter candy and 
carved wooden bear [a bear eating a salmon].) #1
	The name ``Kumaishi'' is derived from ``kuma-us-i'' in Ainu 
language. It means ``fish drying site, many, place.'' The Kanji 
characters for Kumaishi [\u718A\u77F3] mean ``bear, stone.''
 	As for history in Yakumo, in the early Edo era, the Matsumae 
Domain built a guardhouse (ban-sho) in Kumaishi on the Sea of Japan 
side. It became the northern end of Japanese territory. On the Pacific 
Ocean side (Uchiura Bay), there were trading places (basho) in Nodaoi 
[\u91CE\u7530\u8FFD] and Yuurappu [\u904A\u697D\u90E8].
 	In the mid Edo era, the Matsmae Domain built a fort in 
Yamukushinai (later called as Yamakoshinai [\u5C71\u8D8A\u5185]). It 
became the northern end of Japanese territory on the Pacific Ocean 
side. Then, the trading place of Yuurappu was renamed Yamakoshinai.
	The central village was relocated from Nodaoi to Otoshibe 
[\u843D\u90E8] due to an increase in fishing immigrants. (There are 
stations of Otoshibe, Nodaoi, and Yamakoshi [formerly Yamakshinai] 
on the Hakodate Main Line.) The following is the history of Yakumo 
Town after the Meiji period;
	OLD YAKUMO TOWN; In 1872 (Meiji 5), Yamakoshinai office of the 
Hokkaidou Development Commission was established. In 1878 (Meiji 11), 
Tokugawa Farm opened. In 1879 (Meiji 12), administrative offices 
(kochou-yakuba) were established in Yamakoshinai and Otoshibe villages. 
	In 1890 (Meiji 23), the administrative office of Yamakoshinai 
village was moved to Yakumo village. In 1902 (Meiji 35), Yakumo Village 
(2nd-class municipality) was established. In 1903 (Meiji 22), 
Yamakoshinai Station and Yakumo Station on the Hokkaidou Railway (now 
Hakodate Main Line) opened. 
	In 1907 (Meiji 40), Yakumo Village (1st-class municipality) was 
established. (See the note of Matsumae Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class 
municipalities.) In 1915 (Taishou 4), Otoshibe Village (2nd-class 
municipality) was established. In 1919 (Taishou 8), Yakumo Town was 
established. In 1957 (Shouwa 32), Yakumo Town merged Otoshibe Village.
	OLD KUMAISHI TOWN; In 1973 (Meiji 6), administrative offices 
(kochou-yakuba) were established in Kumaishi, Ainumanai [\u76F8\u6CBC
\u5185], and Tomarikawa [\u6CCA\u5DDD] villages. Those were a 
continuation of village chiefs system from the Edo era.
	In 1902 (Meiji 35), the three villages were merged and Kumaishi 
Village (2nd-class municipalities) was established. In 1962 (Shouwa 
37), Kumaishi Town was established. Herring fishing flourished in 
Kumaishi from the Edo era to the Meiji period. The peak of Kumaishi's 
population was 10,049 in 1962 (Shouwa 37).
 	The town hall of Yakumo is located near the mouth of the 
Yuurappu River. It was the town hall of the former Yakumo Town. 
National Route 277 (Unseki-kokudou) branch off from National Route 5 
(Oonuma-kokudou) near the town hall. The Hakodate Main Line runs along 
Uchiura Bay. #2
 	Distinctive industries in Yakumo are animal husbandry, 
agriculture, fishery, and meat processing. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = 
pasture 4,360 hectares in 2015, fodder 989, paddy rice 338, potatoes 90 
(including seed potatoes), adzuki beans 67, soybeans 51, green onions 
20 (mainly Nanpaku-negi), flowers 3, spinach 1, tomatoes 1, 
	(continued) --> other vegetables 95+X (pumpkins and sweet 
corn), and other grains 11; dairy cows 9,111 head in 2015, beef cattle 
4,893, and hens 1,800. STATISTICS OF FISHERIES = right-eye flounder 642 
tons in 2017, salmon 403, squid (flying squid 248, other squid 1), 
Konbu kelp 178, walleye pollock 156, shellfish 144, shrimp/prawns 81, 
	(continued) --> octopus 66, yellowtail 52, crabs (snow crabs 
22, other crabs 16), herring 21, olive flounder 20, Pacific cod 19, sea 
urchins 18, mackerel 16, akta mackerel 15, sharks 9, sea trout 7, 
Hatahata 3, other fish 236, and other marine animals 118. #3 #4
	As for meat processing, Japan Food Packer Dounan Factory 
(Nippon Ham Group) processes pork and beef. There was a Kentucky Fried 
Chicken experiment farm, which changed to a tourist farm. #5 #6
	As for sightseeing, Yakumo Hot Spring and Ken-ichi Hot Spring 
are located along National Route 277. Guinkon-yu Hot Spring is located 
along the Otoshibe River. The name ``Guinkon'' means silver-wedding-
anniversary in Japanese.
	In the former Kumaishi Town, Abalone Festival is held in late 
May. I passed by the festival during an excursion. There were many 
cars. The police guided them.
 
#1  Yoshikatsu Tokugawa asked land granting for the former samurais in 
the Owari Domain (now Aichi Prefecture). It was approved in 1879 (Meiji 
11) and Tokugawa farm was established in Yuurappu district in 
Yamakoshinai village. The area was 496 hectares. (The name ``Yuurappu'' 
comes from ``yu-rap'' in Ainu language. It means ``hot spring, down.'')
	In 1881 (Meiji 14), Yuurappu district became a village by 
separating from Yamakoshinai village. At the time, Yoshikatsu Tokugawa 
named the new village Yakumo. It was named after the oldest poem in the 
country. The lyrics are as follows;
``Yakumo-tatsu izumo-yaegaki tsumagomi-ni yaegaki-tsukuru 
  sono-yaegaki-wo.''
  (Overlapping clouds stand, fences within fences in Izumo, to live 
   with my wife, make fences within fences, the fences within fences).
	It is said that the poem was read by Susanoo-no-mikoto, who was 
a god of mythology. The lyrics are mysterious. Actually, it is an old 
song for weddings (a happy song).
	Tokugawa Farm started Western-style agriculture including dairy 
farming. Farmers in Tokugawa Farm made carved wooden bears in winter.
The craft became a famous souvenir from Hokkaidou. The prototype was a 
carved wooden bear that Yoshichika Tokugawa brougt back from 
Switzerland as a souvenier.
	Tokugawa Farm was demolished after World War II. The Allied 
Powers (US Army) ordered land reform in the country. The area of 
Tokugawa Farm was 5,083 hectares including forests in 1927 (Shouwa 2).
(See Niki Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for large farms.)
	(Troubles over land reform continue. In the case of my 
hometown, a family owns 2 tan (20 ares) of paddy fields, although they 
do not farm. [They lend the land]. The family rented the land just 
before the starting land reform. The landlords says ``It is so 
disgusting I want to kill them''.)
 
#2  National Route 277 in Yakumo Town crosses Unseki Pass and reaches 
Kumaishi. The pass divides Pacific Ocean side and the Sea of Japan 
side. The name ``Unseki'' means ``cloud, stone'' in Japanese. It is a 
combination of Kanji characters for ``un (kumo)'' in Yakumo and 
``seki (ishi)'' in Kumaishi.
	The town hall of the former Kumaishi Town was located in the 
Sea of Japan side. National Route 299 (Hiyama-kokudou) passes nearby. 
It takes about an hour by car to reach the current town hall. There 
were many reasons for the merger.

#3  During the Taishou period (1912-1926), farmers in Yakumo cultivated 
potatoes mainly. Potatoes were processed into potato starch and 
exported to abroad. The exports of potato starch declined due to the 
Great Depression, therefore, dairy farming increased after the 1930s. 
	Today, Yakumo is the main dairy farming region in south 
Hokkaidou. The main breed of dairy cow is Holstein. It is the largest 
breed among cows and cattle. (Cows are for milk and cattle are for 
beef.) A Holstain have black and white skin.
	Holstain was called six-white cow (roppaku-gyuu) in Japanese, 
because there are six white spots around the nose. (See Eniwa City in 
Ishikari sub-prefecture for dairy cows.)

#4  As for fishery in Yakumo, the main catches in Uchiura Bay are 
farmed scallops, salmon, right-eye flounder, and farmed Konbu kelp. 
The main catches in the Sea of Japan side are walleye pollock, squid, 
and farmed abalone. Deep sea water is used for the abalone culture. 
It is rich in minerals and low in bacteria.

#5  As for chicken, I think it tastes better in Hokkaidou. Chickens may 
grow healthy without sweating under the cool climate. In Hokkaidou, 
fried chicken is called Zangui. Maybe, the word comes from Chinese. 
In Japanese, fried chicken is called ``kara-age.'' It means ``Tang 
(old China), deep-fried.''

#6  A meat processing factory is located in Yakumo Town. Swine farms 
are located in mountainous areas of Mori and Imakane towns. In the 
past, Japanese Brazilians worked at the meat processing factory. 
There was a Brazilian restaurant in the center of Yakumo Town.
	Masao Kanamori, who instructed brass band at a local high 
school said; ``I sometimes went to the Brazilian restaurant. I was 
hooked on the bossa nova.''
	Guitar and oboe students at University of Tsukuba also 
recommended ``Aguas de marco [\u00C1guas de mar\u00E7o] (Waters of 
March)'' from Rio de Janeiro. (The name ``Rio de Janeiro'' means 
``River, of, January.)

Oshamanbe [o-sha-ma-n-be] [\u9577\u4E07\u90E8] is a town in Oshima 
sub-prefecture, south Hokkaidou (dou-nan). (The official spelling is 
``Oshamambe.'') It is located in the root of the Oshima Peninsula. The 
area faces Uchiura Bay. The rivers of Oshamanbe, Monbetsu, and Kun-nui 
flow. #1 #2 #3
	The name ``Oshamanbe'' is derived from ``o-samam-pet'' in Ainu 
language. It means ``river mouth, bend, river.'' Or, it is derived from 
``o-samampe'' in Ainu language. It means ``river mouth, flatfish.'' 
 	In 1669, during the Edo era, the Ainu forces led by Shakushain 
advanced from Hidaka to Matsumae. They were defeated by the gun corps 
of the Matsumae Domain along the Kun-nui River. In 1773, the Matsumae 
Domain built a guardhouse (ban-sho) and Inari Shrine. (Incidentally, in 
2022, water gushed out from the shrine's grounds up to a height of 30 
meters). #4
	In 1864, near the end of the Edo era, the trading place of 
Yamakoshinai was abolished. Villages of Yamakoshinai and Oshamanbe were 
established. Yamakoshinai was located in what is now Yakumo Town.
	After the Meiji period, in 1872 (Meiji 5), Oshamanbe office of 
Hakkaidou Development Commission was established. In 1873 (Meiji 6), a 
village chief (kochou) was appointed. It was a continuation of village 
chief system from the Edo era. In 1903 (Meiji 36), Oshamanbe Station on 
Hokkaidou Railway opened (now Hakodate Main Line).
	In 1906 (Meiji 39), Oshamanbe Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established. In 1923 (Taishou 12), Oshamanbe Village (1st-class 
municipality) was established. The Nagawa Line opened (now Muroran 
Main Line) and Oshamanbe Station became a junction.
	In 1943 (Shouwa 18), Oshamanbe Town was established. (See the 
note of Matsumae Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities). 
	The town hall of Oshamanbe and the center of the town are 
located near the mouth of the Oshamanbe River. National Route 37 
(Shizukari-kokudou) branches off from National Route 5 (Oonuma-kokudou 
or Youtei-kokudou). The Muroran Main Line branches off from the 
Hakodate Main Line.
	To the west are Shizukari Pass and Rebungue Pass. Those are 
steep sea cliffs, therefore, the old road and the old railroad, which 
connected Hakodate and Sapporo, went inland from Oshamanbe. The road 
and the railroad are what are now National Route 5 and the Hakodate 
Main Line. #5 #6
	Distinctive industries in Oshamanbe are fishery and dairy 
farming. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = pasture 1,412 hectares in 2015 and 
fodder 239; dairy cows 2,224 head in 2015. STATISTICS OF FISHERIES = 
salmon 386 tons in 2017, shellfish 107 (mainly farmed scallop), 
	(continued) --> right-eye flounder 93, yellowtail 27, sea 
urchins 20, walleye pollock 17, crabs 10 (including horsehair crabs), 
olive flounder 13, flying squid 8, tuna 2, mackerel 1, octopus 1, 
seaweed 1, herring - (zero), other fish 38, and other marine 
animals 17.
	Fishing ports are located in Shizukari, Oshamanbe, Oonaka, and 
Kun-nui. Crabs are the specialty of the town. The lunch box of 
Oshamanbe Station is Kani-meshi (crab rice). #7

#1  Oshima Peninsula is located in the south part of Hokkaidou. On the 
map, the peninsula is defined as a part from the south of a line that 
connects Oshamanbe, Kuromatsunai Basin, and Suttsu Bay.
	As for Oshamanbe River, Natural gas is extracted in the lower 
reache. Futamata Radium Hot Spring, which is a secluded hot spring, is 
located in the upper reach. 
	As for the Kunnui River, the name comes from ``kunne-nay'' in 
Ainu language. It means ``black, river.'' The river was black because 
it contained iron sand. Previously, the iron sand collected in 
Oshamanbe and Yakumo was transported to Muroran for making steel. (See 
Kyougoku Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for iron mine).

#2  Typical river names in Ainu language are ``nay'' and ''pet.'' 
``Nay'' means a stream, whose course may change someday. For example, 
the name is used in Wakkanai, Utashinai, and Kikonai.
	 ``Pet'' means a river, whose course is stable. ``Pet'' is 
called ``betsu'' in place names, for example, Ebetsu, Makubetsu, and 
Shibetsu. Rivers are place names. They are mothers of culture.
	As for typical river names in Japanese, according to Geospatial 
Information Authority Map, searched in March 2025, they are ``Futamata-
gawa'' (the number in Hokkaidou was 54) and ``Futamata-zawa'' (42). The 
name ``Futamata-gawa'' means ``bifurcation river'' and ``Futamata-
zawa'' means ``bifurcation stream.'' Things were simple in the past.

#3  These are rivers that have funny names in Oshamanbe; (1) The 
Kyuushi-battari River, which sounds like ``sudden death river'' in 
Japanese. (2) The Warui River, which means ``bad river'' in Japanese. 
It was bad because salmons did not appear in autumn and timbers could 
not be flowed in the river (by H. Nagata 1891 ``Hokkaidou-ezo-go-
chimei-kai'' [Explanation of Ezo language in Hokkaidou]).
	Cf. The name ``Enbetsu'' in Rumoi sub-prefecture has the same 
meaning. It comes from ``wen-pet'' in Ainu language. It means ``bad, 
river.'' It was bad because there were few salmon. Dried salmon was 
food for Ainu people to survive the long winter.
	These are other rivers who have funny names;
	(1) The Yarikirenai River in Yuni Town, Sorachi sub-prefecture, 
which sounds ``I can't stand it any more!-river'' in Japanese. The name 
comes from ``yanke-nai'' in Ainu language. It means ``no fish, 
stream.''
	(2) The Obake River in Urakawa Town, Hidaka sub-prefecture. It 
means ``ghost river'' in Japanese. Ghosts appeared along the river in 
winter. (Usually, ghosts appear in summer in Japan; See Urakawa Town.)
	(3) The Osaru River in Date City, Iburi sub-prefecture. It 
sounds like ``a little monkey river'' in Japanese. The name comes from 
``o-sar-pet'' in Ainu language. It means ``river mouth, reed, river.'' 
Ainu's houses were made of reeds. In the upstream of the Osaru River, 
there even is Niagara Falls. (See Date City).
	(4) The Chiri-chiri River in Shiriuchi Town, Oshima sub-
prefecture. It sounds ``geography, geography river'' or ``dust, dust 
river'' in Japanese. The name comes from ``chir-chir-nay'' in Ainu 
language. It means ``bird, bird, stream.''
	(5) The Doudoromappu River in Tsubetsu Town, Okhotsk sub-
prefecture. It sounds like ``a muddy map river'' in Japanese. The name 
comes from ``tu-utur-oma-p'' in Ainu language. It means ``two, 
together, enter, river.''
	(6) The Ponkikin River in Tsubetsu Town, Okhotsk sub-
prefecture. In Google search, ``do you mean Ponkikki?,'' which was an 
old TV show. The name comes from ``pon-kikin'' in Ainu language. It 
means ``small, hackberry.''
	(7) The Kemichap River in Tsubetsu Town, Okhotsk sub-
prefecture. It sounds like ``ketchap river.'' The name comes from 
``kene-cha-p'' in Ainu language. It means ``alder, cut, river.'' 
Nature is affuluent in Ainu culture.
	(8) The Bochi-no-sawa River in Oketo Town, Okhotsk sub-
prefecture. It is Japanese and means ``the stream of cemetery.'' When 
I read the name, I remembered ``Boot Hill (cemetery)'' during the 
pioneer years in the USA.
	(9) Gakkari-zawa in Otaru City, Shiribeshi sub-prefecture. It 
is Japanese and means ``disappointment stream.'' It was an old place 
name around Asarigawa Hot Spring. There were hopes and disappointments 
during the pioneer years.

#4  Shakushain was a chief of Ainu people. Before the revolt of 
Shakushain, there were conflicts between Ainu chiefs. A rumor spread 
among Ainu people, ``an Ainu messenger who attempted to borrow weapons 
from the Matsumae Domain was poisoned to death.''
	Then, Ainu chiefs united and revolted in many places. The Ainu 
forces attacked trading ships, gold dust gatereres, and falcon 
catchers. Reading the story of the revolt of Shakushain, I thought; 
``People unite when they have a common enemy. They could not beat 
Western culture (guns).''
	The background to the revolt was the trade imbalance between 
Ainu people and Japanese people. The eruption of Mt. Tarumae in 1667 
may have caused food shortages.

#5  As for the population, the percentage of residents aged 18 to 19 is 
high, because there is Tokyo University of Science has Oshamanbe 
campus. Students come in April and leave in February. The campus opened 
in 1987. It was during the bubble economy. Baby boomers sustain the 
economy and their children (2nd baby boomers) would go to universities.
	* * *
	Looking at the map of population density in the country, 
Hokkaidou looks like a black continent (HTTP://MOOO.COM/NOTE/
INTF1.JPG). Today, most people live in and around large cities. A 
professor who moved to Hokkaidou from the suburb of Tokyo said that 
his house sold for more than he bought. (City residents consume, 
farmers produce.)
	As for the population in Hokkaidou, Hokkaidou University is 
like a water tower of population. It is a large university and students 
come from all over the country and overseas. It has about 18,000 
students. The number is larger than most towns and villages in 
Hokkaidou. (Tokyo Metropolitan University has about 8,500 students.)
	Undergraduate students live in Hokkaidou for four years and 
quite a number of them find jobs in Hokkaidou.
	* * *
	In the 1970s and the 1980s, there were international students 
from Taiwan at University of Tsukuba, where I studied. My teachers 
taught them. In the 1990s, our faculty had an excursion in Taiwan. The 
former international students, who were professors in Taiwan at the 
time, were very kind to us.
	In the 2000s, I did not meet an international student from 
Taiwan, however, I met many Korean students. Today, there are no 
international students from Korea in our department. The countries 
became rich and young people go to the USA and Europe.
	Maybe, there is nothing to learn from this small country, even 
though many Taiwanese and Koreans visit Hokkaidou for sightseeing. I 
talked with a professor from Beijing in 2024. He said, ``Today, Chinese 
students also want to go the USA and European countries. However, Japan 
is still popular because tuition fees are low.''

#6  The east end of Oshamanbe is Rebungue Pass. In the Edo era,
 Rebungue Pass was called as one of the Three Difficult Passes of Ezo 
(old Hokkaidou), along with Saru Pass in Erimo Town (Hidaka sub-
prefecture) and Raiden Pass in Iwanai Town (Shiribeshi sub-prefecture). 
(See Toyoura Town in Iburi sub-prefecture for Rebungue Pass.)

#7  The shape of the Port of Kun-nui is like a wine grass. For the 
shape, fishermen can anchor their fishing boats easily. Kun-nui is 
located at the innermost part of Uchiura Bay. The tidal range is large. 
A long sandy beach appears at low tide. In the past, fishermen got 
troubled to leave the port at low tide.

\u5C71]; POP 5,428 (2010), 7,747 (1990); COUNTRY SIGN = WARRIOR'S 
HELMET.
 
Kaminokuni [ka-mi-no-ku-ni] [\u4E0A\u30CE\u56FD] is a town in Hiyama 
sub-prefecture, south Hokkaidou (dou-nan). The area faces the Sea of 
Japan. Forests occupy 92 percent of the area. The Amanogawa River flows 
from Mt. Tongari. The Ishizaki River flows from Mt. Daisenguen.
	The name ``Kaminokuni'' is Japanese. It means ``upper 
country.'' In the 15th century, the Andou clan in Tsugaru (now Aomori 
Prefecture) entered Ezo (now Hokkaidou Prefecture).
	The Andou clan called the western part ``Kami-no-kuni'' and the 
eastern part ``Shimo-no-kuni.'' ``Kami-no-kuni'' means ``country, of, 
upper'' and ``Shimo-no-kuni'' means ``country, of, lower.''
	 The western part, Kami-no-kuni, was near to the Andou clan's 
homeland. Shimo-no-kuni was located in what is now Hokuto and Hakodate 
cities. The Andou clan also governed Kami-no-kuni and Shimo-no-kuni in 
their home land (now Aomori and Akita prefectures).
	As for history, in the early 13th century, the Andou clan 
traded with Ainu people. They also managed exiles from the Kamakura 
Shogunate. In the mid 15th century, the Nanbu clan advanced to 
Tsugaru, and Masasue Andou and his vassals escaped to Ezo. #1
 	Masasue Andou built 12 forts in Ezo. In the area what is now 
Kaminokuni, there were two; Hanazawa-date and Hiishi-date. Japanese 
settlements were built around the forts. Those were ones of the oldest 
Japanese settlements in Ezo. (See Hakodate City and Nanae Town in 
Oshima sub-prefecture for the Andou clan; See Fukushima Town in Oshima 
sub-prefecture for the oldest Japanese village.) #2 #3
	Koshamain's War occurred in 1457. Koshamain was an Ainu chief. 
Nobuhiro Takeda, who was a vassal of the Andou clan, ended the war. In 
the 16th century, the main fort moved from Kaminokuni to Matsumae. 
During the Edo era (from 17th to 19th century), Kaminokuni was governed 
by the Matsumae Domain. Kaminokuni was a village of temples, shrines, 
and fishing.
	After the Meiji period, in 1872 (Meiji 5), administrative 
offices (kochou-yakuba) were established in Kaminokuni and Shiofuki 
[\u6C50\u5439] villages. Those were a continuation of village chief 
system from the Edo era.
	In 1879 (Meiji 12), three administrative offices were 
established; one was for the villages of (1) Kaminokuni, (2) Kita 
[\u5317], and (3) Oodome [\u5927\u7559]; one was for the villages of (4)
Shiofuki and (5) Kinoko [\u6728\u30CE\u5B50]; and one was for the 
villages of (6) Ishizaki [\u77F3\u5D0E] and (7) Chiisago [\u5C0F\u7802
\u5B50].
	In 1902 (Meiji 35), Kaminokuni Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established by the merger of seven villages. In 1967 (Shouwa 42), 
Kaminokuni Town was established. (See the note of Matsumae Town for 
2nd-class municipality).
	The town hall of Kaminokuni and the center of the town are 
located near the mouth of the Amanogawa River. National Route 228 
(Matsumae-kokudou) runs along the sea. #4 #5
	Previously, the Esashi Line ran along the valley of the 
Amanogawa River. It connected Esashi and Kikonai until 2014. The former 
sites of stations still remain (when I am writing this draft in 2019). 
There was also Amanogawa Station (Milky Way Station) for sightseeing.
	Distinctive industries in Kaminokuni are fishing, paddy rice 
cultivation, and forestry. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 239 
hectares in 2015, beans (soybeans 74, adzuki beans 8, other beans 1), 
wheat 71, buckwheat 37, pasture 5, orchards 5, 
	(continued) --> fodder 4, and other vegetables 30+X (snow peas, 
asparagus, Nira [Chinese chive or gynmigit]); dairy cows X (concealed) 
in 2015. STATISTICS OF FISHERIES = atka mackerel 130 tons in 2017, 
olive flounder 44, sea urchins 34, salmon 27, squid (flying squid 12, 
other squid 15), octopus 25, shrimp/prawns 8, Pacific cod 7, 
	(continued) --> shellfish (abalone 1, other shellfish 6), 
yellowtail 6, tuna 6, right-eye flounder 5, sharks 4, mackerel 4, 
sardines 3, sea trout 1, herring 0, other fish 23, other marine animals 
5. #6 #7
	As for sightseeing, Joukokuji Temple is the oldest building in 
Hokkaidou. The current building was built in 1758. Fort Hanazawa was 
located on a hill near the center of the town. Windmills stand on the 
hill now. #8 #9
 
#1  As for exiles in the early 13th century, thieves and pirates were 
caught in the western country. They were taken to the eastern country 
(now Kantou region). After their trial, some of them were exiled to 
Ezo (now Hokkaidou region).
	As for the explorers of Hokkaidou, Tadataka Inou and Takeshirou 
Matsuura are foumous. (Tadataka Inou explored in 1800 to confirm the  
coastline on the map. Takeshirou Matsuura explored in 1845, 1846, 1849, 
1856, 1857, and 1858 to make gazetteer.)
	More than five centuries before them, Japanese people lived in 
what is now south Hokkaidou.

#2  As for Koshamain's war, in 1456, an Ainu man asked a Japanese 
blacksmith to make a large knife (makiri). When the knife was made, the 
Ainu man quarreled over the quality and the price. The blacksmith got 
angry and stabbed the Ainu man to death with the knife.
	Then, Ainu people united under the chief Koshamain and attacked 
Japanese people in 1457. The Ainu forces destroyed 10 of 12 forts. 
(``Fort'' was called ``date'' in Japanese.)
	These are the destroyed 10 forts; Shinori-date (in what is now 
Hakodate City), Usukeshi-date (Hakodate City), Nakano-date (Kikonai 
Town), Wakimoto-date (Shiriuchi Town), Onnai-date (Fukushima Town), 
Oyobe-date (Matsumae Town), Oodate (Matsumae Town), Nebota-date 
(Matsumae Town), Haraguchi-date (Matsumae Town), and Hiishi-date 
(Kaminokuni Town).
	Japanese people escaped to Hanazawa-date (in what is now 
Kaminokuni Town) and Mobetsu-date (Hokuto City). In 1458, Nobuhiro 
Takeda shot Koshamain and his son to death with a bow. The Koshamain's 
war ended.
	However, the conflict between Ainu people and Japanese people 
continued. Mobetsu-date was also destroyed by the Ainu forces in 1508.

#3  Masasue Andou established 12 forts in Ezo, returned to his home 
land, and built Hiyama Castle, which was located in what is now Noshiro 
City, Akita Prefecture.
	Nobuhiro Takeda ended the Koshamain's War and inherited the 
Kakizaki clan. He changed his family name from Takeda to Kakizaki. 
Kakizaki and Takeda were vassals of the Andou clan.
	Nobuhiro Kakizaki (formerly Nobuiro Takeda) built a new fort. 
The name was Katsuyama-date. It was located next to Hanazawa-date, 
which was the oldest forth.
	His son, Mitsuhiro Kakizaki, moved the main fort from 
Katsuayam-date to Oodate in Matsumae. And his descendant, Yoshihiro 
Kakizaki, founded the Matsumae Domain in the Edo era. (See Matsumae 
Town in Oshima sub-prefecture).

#4  The spelling of the Amanogawa River in Japanese is same as the 
Milky Way. In 1614, Geronimo de Angelis, a Jesuit missionary from 
Sicily island, was heading for Matsumae, however, he landed in 
Kaminokuni due to a heavy storm. Later, he drew an Ezo map and marked 
the landing point `Tcuga [T\u00E7uga] (Tsuga).''
	The old name of Kaminokuni was Tsuga [\u5929\u6CB3]. The 
pronunciation of the Kanji characters changed to Amanogawa [\u5929
\u306E\u6CB3]. The original name `Tsuga' comes from ``to-ka'' in Ainu 
language. It means ``pond, shore.''

#5  The built-up area of Kaminokuni faces the sea. When the Okushiri 
Earthquake occurred in July 1993, the built-up area suffered very 
little damage from tidal waves, because Okushiri island acted as a 
shield between the epicenter and Kaminokuni. In Okushiri, more than 200 
people died. (See Okushiri Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture.)

#6  Year 1993 was a crop failure due to cold weather. At the time, a 
divison of crop failure was set in the town hall of Kaminokuni. Paddy 
rice cultivation was thriving in the town. It was like rural areas in 
Honshuu island.
	During the crop failure, I was a university student. I ate Thai 
rice in the canteen. The rice was urgently imported. Japanese rice 
production is like the ``just-in-time'' method. Neither farmers nor the 
government produce surplus. 
	(Just-in-time method came from Toyota Motor. It was invented 
during the period of scarecity of things after the war. Mass production 
method came from Ford Motor, which was the leader of the world first 
motorization. It happened at the beginning of the 20th century.)
	Year 1993 was a cold summer (``reika'' in Japanese). In the 
year, a large cooler was installed in our laboratory for the first 
time, howerver, we did not used it. When I was a child, if the 
temperature rose by 30 degrees Celsius, it was a hot day. Nowadays, 
the temperature in Tokyo becomes above 36.5 degrees Celsius every day 
in summer.
	Year 2025 was the shortage of rice. It was not caused by low 
summer temperatures. The year was too hot in Tokyo. It was caused by 
market. It was an inbalance between supply and demand. International 
students from Asian countries were surprised by the rising price of 
rice in supermarkets.
	My wife bought Bichiku-mai (the government reserved rice). 
Then, she bought California rice (Calrose). She said, ``My pride does 
not allow it, however...'' (She was born and grown in a rural area.)

#7  Edible mountain plants are called ``sansai'' in Japanese. On May 
19, 2013, I traveled from Kikonai to Kaminokuni on a bus excursion. I 
saw several cars parked in the mountains. People went into the 
mountains to pick edible mountain plants.
	According to a graduation thesis that was submitted to Faculty 
of Letters, Hokkaidou University, in 2013, fern pickers used to come 
Kaminokuni Town from Niigata Prefecture every spring.
	Fern pickers stayed in huts in the mountains to pick, boil, and 
dry ferns. When the harvest season was over, fern pickers rented 
freight trains and shipped dried fern to Oosaka.
	According to Takeo Ichikawa's book ``Nihon-no-shiki-to-kurashi 
(Four seasons and life of Japan)'' published in 1993, edible mountain 
plants grown in snowy regions are large and of good quality. A family 
in Murakami (Niigata Prefecture) earned over one million yen in one 
season by picking wild edible plants such as Zenmai ferns and blacken 
ferns (Warabi).

#8  These are three old buildings in Kaminokuni; (1) Joukokuji Temple; 
A Buddhist temple built in 1443. That was around the year when Fort 
Hanazawa was built. ``Joukoku'' is Japanese. The meaning is the same as 
``Kaminokuni.'' The existing building was rebuild in 1758.
	(2) Tategami-hachiman Shrine; It was built in 1473. That was 
around the year when Fort Katsuyama was built. ``Tategami'' and 
``Hachiman'' are Japanese. These signify gods of war. The existing main 
building was rebuild in 1699. It was moved to the foot of a hill in 
1895 and the name was changed to Kaminokuni-hachiman Shrine.
	(3) The Sasanami's house; A preserved herring mansion (nishin-
goten) in the center of Kaminokuni Town. It was built in the early 19th 
century, during the Edo era. It is the oldest house in Hokkaidou 
(excluding temples and shrines).
	Those temple, shrine, and house are designated as Important 
Cultural Properties. As for the oldest building in Japan, it is 
Houryuuji Temple in Nara Prefecture. It was rebuilt in the 7th century. 
	The main buildings of temples and shrines have no water places 
such as kitchen. Therefore, they last longer than ordinary houses. (See 
Hiyama sub-prefecture for the wood of Houryuuji temple.)
	In the past, monks in temples and priests in shrines were like 
civil servants today. They recorded names of people and places. In 
addition, many people were born and many people died in the past. 
Therefore, many temples exist in traditional towns. Kaminokuni, which 
was the original place of the Matsumae Domain, is one of them.

#9  Ookura herring is one of the old legends in Kaminokuni. It has been 
told since the 1590s (before the Edo era). The story is like this; ``A 
certain year, no herring was caught until the end of May. The fishing 
season was almost over.
	At the time, an elderly monk, Shuukai Ookura, said to 
villagers, `I will pray for herring to come. If you can catch herring, 
please share them with me. I will repair my temple.' Villagers made a 
promise.
	The monk tied up a sacred rope, fasted, and prayed. A week 
later, seagulls covered the sea, Shikabe (albatross) gathered on the 
shore, whales spurted water and made big waves. Schools of herring 
appeared.
	The catch was larger than usual years. Villagers were very 
happy. However, a perverse man refused to give his thanks to the monk, 
saying, `It is just late this year, not your prayer.' He got into a 
fight with the old monk and the monk died. Villagers pray to the monk's 
spirit.
	After that, when a small number of herring washed up on the 
shore in June, villagers called them `Ookura herring'.''
	These are other legends; ``the upside-down water pine (yew),'' 
``the beheading pine,'' and ``the path of god.'' People may have made 
legends during the long winter. (For herring fishing, see Yoichi Town 
in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture, Esashi and Otobe towns in Hiyama sub-
prefecture.)

Esashi [e-sa-shi] [\u6C5F\u5DEE] is a town in Hiyama sub-prefecture, 
south Hokkaidou (dou-nan). The area faces the Sea of Japan. The shape 
of the town is like the letter ``B.'' The narrow part is the mouth of 
the Assabu River. Assabu Town is located in the middle and upper 
reaches of the Assabu River.
 	In the Edo era, Hiba trees (kind of cypress) were actively 
felled in the mountains. The trees were transported down the Assabu 
River. The area what is now Esashi and Assabu towns were the center of 
Hiyama. The name ``Hi-yama'' is Japanese. It means ``cypress 
mountain.'' (See Hiyama sub-prefecture). #1
	The name ``Esashi'' comes from ``e-sa-us-i'' in Ainu language. 
It means ``head, seashore, exist, place.'' It stands for a cape. It 
signified Kamome island in the Port of Esashi. The etymology is the 
same as Esashi Town in Souya sub-prefecture. #2
	As for history, Ubagami-daijinguu Shrine was established in 
1216. It is one of the oldest shrines in Hokkaidou. In the late 17th 
century, during the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain built a port to 
transport cypress. #3 #4
	Herring fishing thrived in the Edo era. During the season of 
herring fishing, fishermen gathered from Honshuu island. The Port of 
Esashi was bustling. Esashi was one of the largest ports of the 
Matsumae Domain along with Fukuyama (Matsumae) and Hakodate. #5
 	In 1868 (Meiji 1), the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces 
occupied Esashi. It was during the Boshin War. In 1869 (Meiji 2), the 
Meiji government forces recaptured Esashi. They advanced to Hakodate 
and defeated the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces.
	In 1872 (Meiji 5), Esashi branch of Hokkaidou Development 
Commission (Kaitaku-shi) was established. Administrative offices 
(kochou-yakuba) were established for 26 towns in the built-up area of 
Esashi. They were a continuation of town chief system from the Edo era.
	In 1880 (Meiji 13), a county office (gun-yakusho) for Hiyama 
and Nishi [\u723E\u5FD7] counties was established. In 1897 (Meiji 30), 
Hiyama sub-prefecture (Hiyama-shichou) was established. The county 
office was abolished.
	In 1900 (Meiji 33), Esashi Town (1st-class municipality) was 
established by the merger of Esashi 26 towns and Gokatte [\u4E94\u52DD
\u624B] village. (See the note of Matsumae Town for 1st-class 
municipality). #6 
	In 1955 (Shouwa 30), Esashi Town merged Tomari [\u6CCA] 
Village. The shape of Tomari was like the letter ``B.'' #7
	The town hall of Esashi, Hiyama sub-prefecture bureau, and the 
Port of Esashi are located to the south. This port is the terminus of 
National Route 227 (Oono-kokudou) and National Route 228 (Matsumae-
kokudou).
	A ferry line connects the Port of Esashi and Okushiri island. 
Previously, the Esashi Line connected Esashi, Kikonai, and Hakodate. 
Near the mouth of the Assabu River, National Route 229 (Hiyama-kokudou) 
branches off from National Route 227. National Route 229 goes north 
along the coast.
 	National Route 227 turns east, runs along the Assabu River, 
crosses the ridge, and leads to the Oono Plain (Hakodate Plain). It was 
one of the road on which the Meiji government forces advanced to 
Hakodate during the Boshin War.
	Distinctive industries in Esashi are fishery and sightseeing. 
STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 268 hectares in 2015, beans 
(soybeans 112, adzuki beans 20, other beans 1), potatoes 48, wheat 32, 
broccoli 21, pasture 13, fodder 7, orchards 4, flowers 3, yams 1, 
	(continued) --> tomatoes 1, other vegetables 35+X, and other 
grains 28; dairy cows X (concealed) in 2015. STATISTICS OF FISHERIES = 
red snow crabs 438 tons in 2017, squid (flying squid 314, other 
squid 2), octopus 59, sea urchins 25, salmon 19, olive flounder 15, 
	(continued) --> yellowtail 7, atka mackerel 7, shellfish 6 
(including Ezo-baka-gai [mactra], abalone), seaweed (Konbu kelp 1, 
other seaweed 5), Pacific cod 5, right-eye flounder 4, sea trout 3, 
shrimp/prawns 3, sharks 1, herring 1, other fish 51, and other marine 
animals 20 (including sea cucumbers).
	Tourist destinations in Esashi includes; (1) Kamome island 
( ``Kamome'' means ``seagull'' in Japanese), (2) Kaiyou Memorial Hall 
(Kaiyou was a battle ship during the Boshin War), (3) the former 
Nakamura residence, which was an old merchant's mansion, and (4) a 
marina in the Port of Esashi. #8 #9 #10 #11
   
#1  As for vegetation in Esashi, Hiyama Ancient Forest (Hiyama-koji-no-
mori) is designated as National Natural Monument (Tennen-kinen-butsu). 
The forest is located near the border with Kaminokuni Town, far from 
the center of Easashi Town.
	The main trees in the forest are Hiba (kind of cypress) and 
Ao-todomatsu (Blue Sakhalin fir). Hiba is also called Hinoki-asunaro 
(See Hiyama sub-prefecture for the name Hinoki-asunaro.) Todomatsu and 
Ezomatsu (Yezo spruce) are typical conifers in Hokkaidou. Todomatsu has 
smooth bark and Ezomatsu has rough bark.
	Esasi-sou (Esashi grass) is a kind of white mullein. The plant 
was imported from Europe in the Meiji period. It naturalized in Esashi 
Town after World War II.

#2  As for the name ``Esashi,'' there is another interpretation. The 
name comes from ``e-sas-us'' in Ainu language. It means ``eat, Konbu 
kelp, exist.'' There is a legend about this; ``Long ago, there was a 
famine. Ainu people in the north coast came here. They could survive 
by eating Konbu kelp.'' (See Shin-hidaka Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture 
for Konbu kelp).

#3  The festival of Ubagami-daijinguu Shrine has continued since 1644. 
It is one of the oldest festivals in Hokkaidou island. A high school 
teacher in Hokkaidou said, ``If you see a festival, you will understand 
the culture.''

#4  Takeshirou Matsuura was an explorer who recorded place names in 
Ezo (now Hokkaidou) during the Edo era. He spent a winter in Esashi in 
1846. It was during his 2nd survey of Ezo island. He earned travel 
expenses by carving seals in Esashi.

#5  Esashi-oiwake is a folk song from Esashi. It is a song for herring 
fishing in the Edo era. (See Yoichi town for the song ``Souran-bush'' 
that was sung during fishing.) These are example lyrics;
``Kuniwo hanarete ah ezogashima yansano-ee, ikuyo nezameno namimakura''
  (I left the country [ah] and came to Ezo island [yansano-ee]. How 
  many nights did I wake up on the wave pillow?)
``Nani-wo yumemite nakukayo chidori nee, kokowa esashino karino yado''
  (What are you calling and dreaming, seagulls? [nee] This is a 
  temporary lodging in Esashi).''
``Esashi-no gogatsuwa edonimo naito, hokoru nishin-no haru-no umi.''
  (May in Esashi is nowhere even in Edo [now Tokyo], proud of the 
  spring sea of herring.)
	* * * 
	In the past, herring shoals spawned off the coast of Hokkaidou 
from March to May. Herring were processed into herring meal and 
transported to Oosaka by Kitamae-bune (north-bound ship). Fertilizer 
wholesalers purchased herring meal.
	In the Edo era, herring meal and dried sardines were called 
``kinpi.'' It means ``gold fertilizer'' or ``money fertilizer'' in 
Japanese. Farmers started to buy fertilizer with money. Previously, 
farmers used leaf litter, livestock manure, and human manure as 
fertilizers.
	The so-called money fertilizer, kinpi, was used for cultivating 
commercial crops such as indigo, rapeseed, and cotton. Those were 
mainly cultivated in western Japan.
	Herring was also processed into Migaki (dried herring for eat) 
and transported to Naichi (main island). (For herring fishing, see 
Yoichi Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture, Otobe Town, and Kaminokuni 
Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture.)

#6  The Gokatte River and the Port of Gokatte are located south of the 
built-up area of Esashi. Gokkate-ya-youkan (sweet bean paste) is a 
souvenir from Esashi. In the Edo era, Gokatte-gumi came from Nanbu 
(now part of Iwate and Aomori Prefectures). Gokatte-gumi was a group 
of lumberjacks. 
	Gokkate-gumi fell trees. They also succeeded in cultivating 
adzuki-beans in Ezo (old hokkaidou). They made sweet adzuki-bean paste 
and presented it to the lord of the Matsumae Domain.

#7  As for the former Tomari Village, the administrative office (kochou-
yakuba) of Tomari village was built in 1878 (Meiji 11) (by ``2016 
Esashi-chou-kyouiku-suishin-keikaku'' [2016 Esashi Town education 
promotion plan]). In 1906 (Meiji 39), Tomari Village (2nd-class 
municipality) was established.
	Before 1955, there were three Tomari villages in Hokkaidou. (1) 
Tomari Village in Hiyama county, Hiyama sub-prefecture. It was merged 
to Esashi Town in 1955. (2) Tomari Village in Furuu county. It is 
located in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture. (3) Tomari Village in Kunashiri 
county. It is located in Kunashir island. Today, Russians live on the 
island.
	When I taught Japanese geography at Hokkaidou University, one 
of Russian students said, pointing at Kunashir (Kunashiri) island on 
the map,  ``This map is funny. I do not care, however, Russians live in 
the island. They feel sad if they see this map.'' 
	I replied, ``This is a national university. I could buy only 
this map.'' (Kunashir island is a disputed island.)

#8  Kamome island in Esashi is a tombolo, which means a linked island. 
These are tourist sites in Kamome island; (1) Heishi Rock; It looks 
like a religious vase. (2) Senjou-jiki; A large flat rock eroded by 
waves. The name ``Senjou'' means 1000 tatami mats. (3) Yoshitsune-no-
uma-iwa; A white rock that looks like the horse of Yoshitsune Minamoto. 
	(continued) --> (4) Benkei-no-ashiato; Large two holes on flat 
rock. They look like footprints of Benkei Musashibou. Musashibou was a 
monk soldier and a vassal of Yoshitsune Minamoto. (See Biratori Town in 
Hidaka sub-prefecture and Otobe Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for 
Yoshitsune legends.) The hole along the cost is called ``en-kama.'' 
	(continued) --> (5) Tokugawa Shogunate battery site. The guns 
were set up by the Matsumae Domain in 1852. (6) Sand beaches; Two sandy
beaches are open in summer.

#9  Kaiyou was a battleship of the Tokugawa Shogunate. It was made in 
the Netherlands. During the Boshin War, the former Tokugawa Shogunate 
forces advanced from Hakodate to Matsumae and to Esashi. The battleship 
took a course from Hakodate to Esashi.
	After the occupation of Esashi, in December 1869 (Meiji 1), the 
battleship ran aground and sank due to a strong wind. The wind is 
called ``Taba-kaze (Taba wind).'' It is a local wind in winter.
	Tokugawa Shogunate's commander Toshizou Hijikata thought of the 
sunken ship and cried, hitting the trunk of a pine tree. Later, a not 
appeared on the pine tree and it was called ``Toshizou's fist.'' It is 
the Pine of Lament (nageki-no-matsu) in front of the old administrative 
office of Hiyama and Nishi counties. (See Hakodate City in Oshima sub-
prefecture for the Bohin War.)

#10  As for the local wind ``Taba-kaze,'' which sank the battleship 
Kaiyou, blows from the northwest in winter. Japanese fishermen feared 
the wind. They believed that the wind had a soul, so they called it 
Tama-kaze (soul wind). The pronunciation was changed to Taba-kaze.
	Houses in Esashi were surrounded by fences in winter. The 
fences were made of tree branches. The sound of the wind hitting the 
fences was called ``Mogari-bue (Mogari fence whistle).'' That was the 
sound-scape of Esashi in winter.
	Nowadays, windmills stand in the mountains. They are managed by 
Esashi Wind Power, a subsidiary of J-Power (Electric Power Development 
Company).
	These are local winds in Hokkaidou island; (1) Taba-kaze in 
Esashi Town, Hiyama sub-prefecture, (2) Dashi-kaze in Suttsu Town, 
Shiribeshi sub-prefecture, (3) Hidaka-shimo-kaze in Samani Town, Hidaka 
sub-prefecture, 
	(continued) --> (4) Shikata in Erimo Town, Hidaka sub-
prefecture, (5) Aikaze in Ishikari City, Ishikari sub-prefecture, and 
(5) Bafun-kaze in the Tokachi Plain, Tokachi sub-prefecture and other 
places.
	In the past, due to a strong wind in early spring, 60 herring 
fishing boats sank. (See Haboro Town in Rumoi sub-prefecture.) A novel 
depicts Kuma-kaze (bear wind). When a man-eating bear was kiled, a 
strong wind blew. (See Tomamae Town in Rumoi sub-prefecture for the 
man-eating bear.)
        * * *
        Long ago, an elderly Ainu woman whose name was Orii lived near 
the Port of Esashi. She was a prophet. She predicted weather and wind. 
She also mentioned the size of the net that herring fishermen used. The 
size was 5-shaku 3-sun (160 centimeters) in hight and had 63 meshes. It 
was a small net.
	During the Edo era, people followed her words. Herring came 
every year. After the Meiji period, people used larger nets and the 
catch of herring decreased. Incidentally, the average hight of a man 
was about 5-shaku (152 centimeters) in the Edo era.

#11  As for old buildings in Esashi, the former Nakamura's residence 
has been designated as an Important Cultural Property of Japan. It was 
built between the end of the Edo era and the Meiji period. The owner 
was a merchant from Oumi (now Shiga Prefecture).
	The Nakamura's residence was a shipping wholesaler. The 
buildings in the residence are connected by passages. The architecture 
is called kaisen-donya-kenchiku [\u56DE\u8239\u554F\u5C4B\u5EFA\u7BC9] 
(shipping wholesaler architecture).
	In the past, along the Port of Esashi, merchant residences 
like the Nakamura's residence were lined up. The buildings had piers on 
the water to transport cargo to ships.
	The ships of Oomi merchants were called Kitamae-bune (north-
bound ships). The hometown of Oumi merchants was what is now Higashi-
oumi City. Esashi Town and Higashi-oumi City in Shiga Prefecture are 
sister cities. 
	The type of the north-bound ship was called Sengoku-bune. It 
means the ship that can carry 1000-koku of rice. One koku is about 150 
kg of rice. The sales of one voyage per ship amounted to 1000 ryou of 
money in the mid Edo era. 
	One koku of rice was about one ryou of money in the mid Edo 
era. It was equivalent to about 50,000 yen today. (See Otobe Town in 
Hiyama sub-prefecture for one koku of herring; See Kuriyama Town in 
Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for one koku of rice wine.)

Assabu [a-ssa-bu] [\u539A\u6CA2\u90E8] is a town in Hiyama sub-
prefecture, south Hokkaidou (dou-nan). It is an inland town. The area 
corresponds to the basin of the Assabu River, which flows to the Sea of 
Japan. The area of Assaabu seems to face the sea, however, the mouth of 
the Assabu River is included in Esashi Town.
	As for vegetation, Assabu is the northern limit of Hiba (or 
Hinoki Asunaro, a kind of cypress) and the southern limit of Todo-matsu 
(a kind of fir). (See Hiyama sub-prefecture for Hiba tree.)
	The name ``Assabu'' is derived from ``hacam-pet'' in Ainu 
language. It means ``starling, river.'' It signified the Assabu River. 
The etymology is the same as Hassamu in Nishi Ward, Sapporo City, 
Ishikari sub-prefecture. #1
 	In the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain cut cypress trees after the 
1670s. Woodcutters from the main island (now Honshuu island) 
immigrated. After the Meiji period, in 1868 (Meiji 1), the Matsumae 
Domain established Tate Castle. The castle was located in the upper 
reaches of the Assabu River. It was used during the Boshin War (1868-
1869). #2 #3
	In 1876 (Meiji 9), the administrative office (kochou-yakuba) of 
Gamushi [\u4FC4\u866B] village was established. It was a continuation 
of village chief system from the Edo era. #4
	In 1879 (Meiji 12), the administrative office of Gamushi was 
re-established. It covered four villages; Gamushi, Tsuchihashi [\u571F
\u6A4B], Mena [\u76EE\u540D], and Akanuma [\u8D64\u6CBC].
	In 1800 (Meiji 13), the administrative office of Gamushi was re-
established. It covered five villages; Gamushi, Tsuchihashi, Mena, 
Akanuma, and An-noro [\u5B89 \u91CE\u5442]. Those five villages existed 
in the Edo era for forestry. 
	In 1801 (Meiji 14), the administrative office of Gamush was re-
established. It covered seven villages; Gamushi, Tsuchihashi, Mena, 
Akanuma, An-noro, Tate [\u9928], and Uzura [\u9D89].
	In 1906 (Meiji 39), Assabu Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established by the merger of seven villages. In 1963 (Shouwa 38), 
Assabu Town was established. (See the note of Matsumae Town for 2nd-
class municipality.)
	The town hall of Assabu and the center of the town are located 
near the confluence of the Assabu River and the An-noro River. The town 
hall was built at the site of Hiyama Agricultural Experiment Station.
	National Route 227 (Oono-kokudou) passes the center of the 
town. In the past, the national highway was called Uzura-sandou (Quail 
mountain trail). It was one of the routes that the Meiji government 
forces advanced to Hakodate.
	Distinctive industries in Assabu are agriculture and forestry. 
STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = beans (soybeans 484 hectares in 2015, 
adzuki beans 196, other beans 7), paddy rice 555, potatoes 489, wheat 
373, buckwheat 171, sugar beets 44, orchards 37 (grapes 21), 
	(continued) --> pasture 24, broccoli 24, cabbage 22, fodder 21, 
barley 17, green onions 7, melons 6, carrots 2, yams 1, Chinese cabbage 
1, spinach 1, flowers 1, other vegetables 346+X (including pumpkins, 
asparagus, sweet corn), and other grains 77; dairy cows - (zero) in 
2015. #5
	May-queen potatoes are a local specialty. May-queen is a 
popular cultivar along with Danshaku (baron). The country sign of 
Assabu shows a May-queen boy or girl whose face is long and smooth. #6
  
#1  Staling (white-cheeked starling or grey starling) is called 
Muku-dori in Japanese. It means ``Muku tree, bird.'' Muku tree is a 
kind of deciduous broad-leaved tree.
	In Hokkaidou island, the bird is also called Sakura-dori, which 
means ``cherry tree, bird.'' The bird migrates from the south during 
the cherry blossom season. (See Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture 
for the cherry blossom season in Hokkaidou).
	When I lived in Tsukuba City, Ibaraki Prefecture, a huge flock 
of starlings covered the evening sky. I watched it from the balcony.
The sky suddenly darkened.

#2  In the Edo era, tree felling started in early winter in Ezo (old 
Hokkaidou). The forest floor was covered with snow, providing good 
visibility. Woodcutters could move easily. They cut cypress trees. 
	Cypress trees in Hokkaido island are ``hiba,'' and cypress 
trees in Honshu island are ``hinoki'' and ``hiba.'' (See Hiyama sub-
prefecture for cypress.)
	Woodcutters hauled logs to the river on sleighs. Melting snow 
flooded the river in spring. Woodcutters floated the logs down the 
river.
	The woodcutter brought Dear Dance (Shishi-odori) from their 
homeland to Assabu. The dance became the annual event at the guardhouse 
of Hiyama. Guardhouses were called ``ban-sho'' in Japanese. They were
run by the Matsumae Domain.
	A large forest fire occurred in 1695. Then, the Matsumae Domain 
banned logging from 1770 to 1807 to prevent deforestation. Another 
large forest fire occurred in 1876. Thus, very few natural forests 
remain. Tourists see huge forests in Hokkaidou and think they are 
natural, however, those were burned in the past.
	In Assabu Town, only one protected area has designated as 
National Natural Monument since 1928. The name is ``Uzura-gawa-goyou-
matsu-jisei-hokugen-chitai (the northern limit of white pine natural 
growing area along the Uzura River).'' (See Esashi Town in Hiyama sub-
prefecture for another natural forest.)
	As for snowy mountains, a female member of Hokkaidou University 
Mountaineering Club said, ``When it snows, we can go into mountains 
that we could not in summer.'' There are also no mosquitoes and bears. 
	As for sleigh and sled, people have used them since ancient 
times. In Sapporo City, parents move their children using plastic 
sleds. (See Naie Town in Sorach sub-prefecture for sleigh.)

#3  Tate Castle of the Matsumae Domain was built inland to avoid naval 
artillery. The previous Fukuyama Castle (Matsumae Casle) was located 
along the coast. (For the same reason, the capital of the Choushuu 
Domain moved from Hagui along the coast to Yamaguchi inland. It was in 
1863. Then, the Edo era ended in 1867.)
	In December 1868 (Meiji 1), during the Boshin War, the former 
Tokugawa Shogunate forces advanced to Matsumae Castle. The Matsumae 
Domain's forces escaped to Tate Castle. (It was November by the lunar 
calendar used at the time.)
	In Tate Castle, Mikami Choujun, a monk soldier of the Matsumae 
Domain, fought using a cutting board as a shield. He was killed to 
allow his allies to escape. Tate Castle was captured and burned by the 
former Tokugawa Shogunate forces.
	The lord of the Matsumae Domain could find a ship in Kumaishi. 
He and his family set sail to the rough winter sea. They headed for 
Hirosaki. Then, the Matsumae Domain's forces surrendered. Kumaishi is 
located in what is now Yakumo Town.
	In May 1869, the Meiji government forces landed near the mouth 
of the Himekawa River. The Meiji government forces advanced south and 
occupied Esashi. (The Himekawa River is located in Otobe Town.)
	In June 1869, the Meiji government forces advanced to Hakodate 
and ended the Boshin War. (It was May of the lunar calendar used at the 
time; See the note of Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the 
Boshin War.)
	After the Boshin War, the Matsumae Domain was renamed the Tate 
Domain. In August 1871 (Meiji 4), all domains in Japan were abolished. 
Prefectures were established. In Hokkaidou, Tate Prefecture was 
established in the south, and the other areas were governed by the 
Hokkaidou Development Commission. 
	In October 1871, Tate Prefecture was merged to Aomori 
Prefecture. In 1872 (Meiji 5), the Hokkaidou Development Commission 
governed the whole Hokkaidou, including the former Tate Prefecture. 
Meiji was a turbulent period. (During a turbulent period, new 
religions emerge; See Hokkaidou University in Sapporo City.)
 
#4  The name Gamushi comes from ``kamuy-us-i'' in Ainu language. It 
means ``god, exist, place.'' Probably, the god means bears. Ainu people 
considered bears to be gods. Today, there is Gamushi Hot Spring along 
the tributary of the An-noro River. (See Noboribetsu City in Iburi sub-
prefecture for bear.)

#5  Local specialties in Assabu are Hikari-kuro-daizu (shining black 
soybeans) and black-bean pudding. Black soybeans are suitable for 
machine harvesting, because the color hides the stains of the juice 
(astringents and tannins), which harvesters splatter while cutting the 
stems.

#6  The potato cultivar ``May-queen'' was bred in 1900 by the British 
seed company Sutton & Sons. May-queen was named after the queen who was 
chosen at the May Day festival.
	May-queen was imported to Japan from the USA during the Taishou 
period (1912-1925). In 1928 (Shouwa 3), Hiyama Agricultural Experiment 
Station designated May-queen and Danshaku as recommended potato 
cultivars.
	(Hiyama Agricultural Experiment Station was located in Gamushi 
district, Assabu Village. See Imakane Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture and 
Kucchan Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for Danshaku potatoes.)
	May-queen is a popular ingredient in Oden (winter pot dish) in 
the Kansai region. (Kansai is located in the central part of Japan, 
however, it is considered as ``western Japan [nishi-nihon].) May-queen 
potatoes do not fall apart when they are soaked in hot soup for a long 
time. I grew up in eastern Japan and have never seen potatoes in Oden.
	* * *
	Sapporo Shusei is a distilling company. The head office is 
located in Nishi Ward, Sapporo City, Ishikari sub-prefecture. A factory
of Sapporo Shusei is located along the Assabu River.
	Sapporo Shusei in Assabu makes Shouchuu (liquor). The liquor 
is distilled from potatoes and sweet potatoes, which are cultivated in 
south Hokkaidou. Next to the distilling factory is a potato shipping 
center run by an agricultural cooperative. (See Nishi Ward in Sapporo 
City for liquor production.)
	I did not know that sweet potatoes are cultivated in Hokkaidou 
as a commercial crop. Sweet potatoes are cultivated under a warm 
climate. 
	The seed potatoes of sweet potatoes die in the cold winter. In 
my hometown, the seed potatoes were preserved in deep holes, about the 
height of a man. (by T. Nihei et al. 2000. Regional characteristics of 
production and distribution of sweet potatoes in Hitachi-naka City.

#1
 
Otobe [o-to-be] [\u4E59\u90E8] is a town in Hiyama sub-prefecture, 
south Hokkaidou (dou-nan). The area is located in the west of the 
Oshima Peninsula. It faces the Sea of Japan. Forests occupy 87 percent 
of the area.
	The name ``Otobe'' comes from ``o-to-un-pe'' in Ainu language. 
It means ``river mouth, swamp, exist, thing (river).'' It signified 
the Hime River, which flows through the center of the town. In the Edo 
era, the river was called Otohe (by Takeshirou Matsuura's map published 
in 1859; http://koukita.github.io/touzaiezo/map/). #2
	In the Edo era, the area was governed by the Matsumae Domain. 
Herring fishing thrived. According to oral tradition, Hanaiso-suwa 
Shrine was established in 1617 (Guen-na 3). The name of the shrine 
is recorded in a document written in 1704. #3
	After the Meiji period, the new government forces landed at 
Otobe in May 1869 (Meiji 2). They advanced to Esashi and to Hakodate, 
and defeated the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces. The Boshin War 
ended. (The Boshin War was a civil war.) #4
	In 1879 (Meiji 12), the administrative office (kochou-yakuba) 
of Otobe village was establised. It covered villages of Komonai [\u5C0F
\u8302\u5185] and Toppu [\u7A81\u7B26]. The administrative office of 
Mitsuya [\u4E09\u30C4\u8C37] village was established. It covered 
Kabashira [\u868A\u67F1] village.
	In 1902 (Meiji 35), Otobe Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established by the merger of five villages. In 1965 (Shouwa 40), Otobe 
Town was established. (See the note of Matsumae Town for 2nd class 
municipality.)
	The town hall of Otobe is located near the mouth of the Hime 
River. National Route 229 (Hiyama-kokudou) runs along the sea. The 
national highway connects old settlements that flourished in fishery 
or forestry. #5
	Distinctive industries in Otobe are fishery, agriculture, fish 
processing, and forestry. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 127 
hectares in 2015, soybeans 89, broccoli 26, adzuki beans 17, fodder 9, 
pasture 4, strawberries 2, orchards 2, radishes 1,
	(continued) --> other vegetables 32+X (including lily bulbs), 
and other grains 20; dairy cows - (zero) in 2015. STATISTICS OF 
FISHERIES = walleye pollock 286 tons in 2017, squid (flying squid 214, 
other squid 1), sea urchins 39, octopus 32, salmon 13, Pacific cod 5,
	(continued) --> olive flounder 3, Konbu kelp 3, shrimp/prawns 
2, yellowtail 1, right-eye flounder 1, atka mackerel 1, abalone 1, 
herring 0, other fish 17, and other marine animals 16 (including sea 
cucumbers).
	Fishing ports are located in Otobe, Guen-na, and Toyohama. As 
for other industries, a factory of CAC Cosmetics and Tomioka winery are 
located. The founder of CAC Cosmetics was born in a pharmacy in Otobe. 
	Tomioka winery was founded in 1976. A distilling company, 
Sapporo-shusei, acquired Tomioka winery in 2008. The head office of 
Sapporo-shusei is located in Nishi Ward, Sapporo City, Ishikari sub-
prefecture.
	As for sightseeing, Guen-na-dai Beach Park has been selected as 
one of the 100 Beaches of Japan. It was designated by the Ministry of 
the Environment. It is the only 100 Beaches in Hokkaidou island. The 
country sign (gateway sign) of Otobe depicts the artificial seawater 
pool at Guen-na-dai Beach Park.
	Other scenic sites include; (1) Cape Shibi-no-saki, which is 
andesite columnar joints that resemble tuna scales. The word``shibi'' 
means tuna in old Japanese, (2) Cape Tateno-saki, whose nickname is the 
Grand Canyon of the Orient, and (3) Takise coast, which is known for 
Shira-hura (white sea cliffs). #6
 
#1  The Kanji characters for Nishi county (Nishi-gun) are difficult to 
read even for Japanese people. In the beginning of the Meiji period, 
Takeshirou Matsuura, who was an explorer of Ezo (now Hokkaidou), 
suggested Nishi-gun [\u897F\u90E1] (west county) for the county name, 
however, the Meiji government adopted the difficult Kanji characters 
[u723E\u5FD7\u90E1], because there were identical place names in 
Honshuu island.

#2  As the name Otohe (river mouth, swamp, exist, thing) signifies, 
there were many swamps and ponds in the lower reaches of the Hime River 
(the former Otohe River). The swamps and ponds were reclaimed and 
turned into paddy fields and a built-up area.
	The current river name ``Hime'' means ``princess'' or ``noble 
lady'' in Japanese. In the case of Otobe Town, it refers to Shizuka-
gozen, who was a Mekake (concubine) of Yoshitsune Minamoto.
	Yoshitsune Minamoto was a commander of the Minamoto clan in 
the 12th century. He was killed in battle in Oushuu (now Touhoku 
region), however, many legends mention that he fled to Ezo (old 
Hokkaidou). This is one of the Yoshitune legends in Otobe;
	``Shizuka-gozen came Otohe in search of Yoshitune, however, 
he had escaped far inland and she could not find him. She was 
disappointed and committed suicide by drowning in the river.'' 
According to this legend, the river's name was changed from Otohe to 
Hime (Shizuka-gozen).
	I guess that the legend depicts the death of a courtesan 
[kootizan] (prostitute) in the end of Edo era or the Meiji Period. 
There is Oiran-buchi in Minami Ward, Sapporo City, Ishikari sub-
prefecture. Oiran-buchi means ``Oiran (courtesan), (killed herself), 
abyss.'' 
	(See Biratori Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture and Esashi Town in 
Hiyama sub-prefecture for Yoshitsune legends; She Oshamanbe Town in 
Oshima sub-prefecture for river names.)

#3  During the Tenmei period (1781-1789) in the Edo era, Otobe was 
Sengoku-basho of herring. The word ``Sengoku-basho'' means ``a trading 
place that has 1,000 koku catches of herring.''
	The word ``koku'' is an old unit of measurement. One ``koku'' 
was equivalent to 150 kg of dried herring or 200 kg of fresh herring. 
(See Esashi Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for one koku of rice; See 
Kuriyama Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for one koku of rice wine.)
 	During the Tenmei Famine (1782-1788) and the Tenpou Famine 
(1833-1839), people migrated to Otobe from Nanbu (now Iwate and Aomori 
prefectures), Hirosaki (now Aomori Prefecture), and Akita.
	In Otobe Town, there are districts of Sakaehama (``thriving 
beach'' in Japanese) and Toyohama (``rich beach'' in Japanese). Those 
names remind us of the good old days. Herring disappeared in 1917 
(Taishou 6). (See Yoichi Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture and Esashi 
Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for herring fishing).

#4  In December 1868 (Meiji 1), during the Boshin War, the Tokugawa 
Shogunate forces advanced to the castle of the Matsumae Domain (now 
Matsumae Town). (It was November of the lunar calendar used at the 
time.)
	The Matsumae Domain's forces escaped to Tate Castle in Assabu. 
Tate Castle also fell. They escaped to Otobe. The lord of the Matsumae 
Domain escaped to Hirosaki (now Aomori Prefecture) and the rest of the 
Matsumae Domain's forces surrendered.
	Villagers in Otobe hid Matsumae soldiers by dressing them 
in farmer's clothes. (See Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for 
the Boshin War; See Assabu Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the end of 
the Matsumae Domain.)
 
#5  A bus stop ``Otobe-juuji-gai'' is located near the town hall. The 
name``Juuji-gai'' is Japanese. It means ``cross-like, street.'' The 
word ``juu-ji'' originally means ``ten, character.'' The shape of the 
Kanji character ``ten [\u5341]'' is a cross.
	The place name``Juuji-gai'' can be found not only in Otobe but 
also in Fukagawa, Hakodate, Kushiro, Okushiri, Shikaoi, Rumoi, and 
Yoichi in Hokkaidou.
	(``Juu'' is a mysterious character. When it represents 
numbers, it becomes ``10,'' ``1,'' and ``0.'' For example, ''juu'' 
means 10, ``juu-go'' means 15, and ``ni-juu'' means 20.)
	* * *
	In contrast to cross-like streets (juuji-gai), castle towns in 
Honshuu island have T-junctions (teiji-ro) and crank-shaped roads 
(kaguino-te). Those complicated roads were constructed for defensive 
purposes. Today, those are obstructs for automobile traffic. (See 
Toubetsu Town in Ishikari sub-prefecture for a crank-shaped road.)
	Motorization in Japan started after the late 1960s. My father 
bought Nissan Cherry in the 1970s. When I read a novel ``The Grapes of 
Wrath,'' I found that the motorization in the USA started in the early 
20th century.

#6  The name ``Guen-na-dai'' in Otobe signifies the Guen-na period 
(1615-1624) in the Edo era. The fishing port of Guen-na was built in 
the period. It is an old fishing port.
	To the north of Cape Shibi-no-saki, there was Kabashira 
village. The Port of Toyohama is located there. Kabashira is a funny 
name. It means ``mosquito pillar'' in Japanese. The name comes from 
``kapara-sirar'' in Ainu language. It means ``flat, rock.'' (Once, I 
saw a large mosquito pillar in a hotel room in a tropical region.) 
	As for Shira-fura cliff, I guess that the name comes from 
``sirar-hu-ra'' in Ainu language, which means ``rock, raw, intestine.'' 
The eroded cliff looks like intestines of fish.

Okushiri [o-ku-shi-ri] [\u5965\u5C3B] is a town in Hiyama sub-
prefecture, south Hokkaidou (dou-nan). The area is Okushiri island in 
the Sea of Japan. It is the second largest island in Hokkaidou after 
Rishiri.
	The area is about the same size as Lake Saroma. Coastal 
terraces are located to the east, paddy field to the south, and coastal 
cliffs to the west and north. Forests cover 86 percent of the area.
 	The name ``Okushiri'' comes from ``i-kus-un-sir'' in Ainu 
language. It means ``it, over there, exist, island.'' Or, it comes from 
``i-kus-sir'' in Ainu language. It means ``it, over there, island.'' 
Both words signified Okushiri, which is an island across the sea as 
seen from Kumaishi.
	In the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain built Kujiri-basho (a 
trading place) in the island. Herring fishing prospered through the Edo 
era to the Meiji period. In 1879 (Meiji 12), an administrative office 
(kochou-yakuba) was built for the villages of Tsurikake [\u91E3\u61F8], 
Akaishi [\u8D64\u77F3], Yakushi [\u85AC\u5E2B], and Aonae [\u9752
\u82D7].
	In 1906 (Meiji 39), Okushiri Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established by the merger of four villages. In 1966 (Shouwa 41), 
Okushiri Town was established. (See the note of Matsumae Town for 2nd-
class municipality.)
	The town hall of Okushiri is located in Okushiri district to 
the east. Other built-up areas are located in Aonae district to the 
south and Kamui-waki district (Yunohama district) to the west.
	Heart Land Ferry connects ports of Okushiri, Setana, and 
Esashi. Okushiri Airport opened in 1974 in Aonae district. Hokkaidou 
Air System connects Okushiri and Hakodate airports. 
	Distinctive industries in Okushiri are fishing, food 
processing, and sightseeing. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = pasture 41 
hectares in 2015, paddy rice 37, and orchards 31; dairy cows X 
(concealed) in 2015 and beef cattle X. STATISTICS OF FISHERIES = squid 
(flying squid 417 tons in 2017, other squid 8), sea urchins 111, 
	(continued) --> Pacific cod 69, octopus 59, atka mackerel 58,

7, puffer fish 5, seaweed 5, olive flounder 4, yellowtail 1, herring - 
(zero), other fish 52, and other marine animals 23.
	As for food processing, local specialties are rice wine (sake) 
and wine. As for sightseeing, Nabetsuru Rock, which is the icon of the 
island, is located near the ferry port.
	Okushiri Tsunami Museum is located in Aonae district. The 
country sign (gateway sign) of Okuhsiri is a map of the island. It 
illustrates strange shaped rocks and Bentenguu Shrine. #1 #2 #3

#1  In the past, Okushiri was an island of alcohol prohibition. When 
the catch of herring was poor, fishermen drunk a lot and quarreled. 
Therefore, village chief (kochou) banned drinking alcohol from 1885 to 
1890.
	Today, rice wine (sake) and wine are the specialties of the 
island. There even is an ``Ordinance to promote toasts with Okushiri's 
local rice wine.'' People became polite even when drinking rice wine. 
(See Asahikawa City in Kamikawa sub-prefecture for rice wine; See Ikeda 
Town in Tokachi sub-prefecture for wine.)

#2  Okushiri island is located near the boundary between the Eurasian 
Plate and North American Plate. In July 1993, the Okushiri Earthquake, 
whose magnitude was 7.8, happened and killed 230 people. It was due to 
tidal waves (tsunami), fires, and landslides.
	Being close to the epicenter, the first tidal wave arrived two 
to three minutes after the earthquake. Tidal waves killed 198 people. 
Soon after the earthquake, television channels were broadcasting live 
footage from the sky. In that night, Aonae district was burning.
	In 1998, the town declared ``completion of recovery.'' In 2001, 
Tsunami Museum opened.
	* * *
	The Sanriku Coast in the Touhoku region was hit by tidal waves. 
At an elementary school along the coast, all children could escaped 
from the massve tidal waves in 2011. Their grand parents taught them 
the word ''tsunami-tendenko.'' This means that ``if a large earthquake 
occurs, you must escape alone as soon as possible.''

#3  These are strange shaped rocks in the island. (1) Nabe-tsuru Rock, 
which resembles a handle of iron pot, (2) Kabuto Rock (warrior's helmet 
rock), (3) Hoya Rock (sea pineapple rock), (4) Mottate Rock (erection 
rock), and (4) Muean-jima (lonely island).
	The shape of Nabe-tsuru Rock was changed by a large earthquake 
in 1993. It was restored. There are unique stories with the unique 
rocks. Traveling to a remote island strongly fascinates some people.

AREA 639 KM2 (2010), FOREST 500, CULTIVATED 54; COUNTY = KUDOU [\u4E45
\u9060]; POP 9,590 (2010), 13,389 (1990 - KITA-HIYAMA 7,030, SETANA 
3,191, TAISEI 3,168); MEAN ANNUAL TEMP 8.8 C (AV 1981-2010), PRECIPI 
1,056 MM; COUNTRY SIGN = ROCKS ON THE SEA.

Setana [se-ta-na] is a town in Hiyama sub-prefecture, south Hokkaidou 
(Dou-nan). It is located in the west of the Oshima Peninsula, facing 
the Sea of Japan. Cape Obana is the westernmost end of Hokkaidou 
island. Ordinary tourists cannot go to there, because it is a steep 
sea cliff. #1
 	The area was newly delimited in 2005 by the merger of three 
towns; Taisei [\u5927\u6210], Kita-hiyama [\u5317\u6A9C\u5C71], and 
Setana [\u702C \u68DA] (from south to north).
	The name Taisei means ``big success'' in Japanese. It was named 
by local residents when Kudou [\u4E45\u9060] Village and Kaitorima 
[\u8C9D\u53D6\u6F97] Villages were merged in 1955. The name Kita-hiyama 
means ``north cypress-mountain'' in Japanese. (See Hiyama sub-
prefecture for the name Hiyama.)
	The name ``Setana'' comes from ``seta-rupespe-nay'' in Ainu 
language. It means ``dog, cross, river.'' It signified a place near the 
Baba River, which flows the center of the old Setana Town. Large rocks 
stand near the mouth of the river. They are Sanbonsugi-iwa (Three-
ceders Rocks) standing from the sea and Rousoku-iwa (Candle Rock) at 
the port. They look like dogs. #2
	In the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain established three trading 
places (basho) for fishing. They were located in Kudou, Futoro, and 
Setanai (from south to north). They thrived from herring fishing. 
(Futoro was located at the mouth of the Fotoro River in the former 
Kita-hiyama Town).
	After the Meiji period, three counties were established in 1869 
(Meiji 2). They are Kudou, Futoro, and Setana. The following is the 
history of old towns.
	OLD TAISEI TOWN; In 1872 (Meiji 5), Kudou office of the 
Hokkaidou Development Commission was established. In 1880 (Meiji 13), 
the administrative office (kochou-yakuba) of Issouma [\u4E00\u8258
\u6F97] village was established.
	The administrative office of Issouma covered six villages; 
Issouma, Oota [\u592A\u7530], Uekotan [\u4E0A\u53E4\u4E39], Sansouma 
[\u4E09\u8258\u6F97], Hikata-tomari [\u65E5\u65B9\u6CCA], and Yunoshiri 
[\u6E6F\u5C3B].
	In the same year, the administrative office of Hiratanai 
[\u5E73\u7530\u5185] was established. It covered tree villages; 
Hiratani, Kaitorima, and Nagaiso [\u9577\u78EF]. In 1881 (Meiji 14), 
the administrative office of Kudou village was established by the 
merger of Issouma, Sansouma, and Hikata-tomari.
	In 1902 (Meiji 35), Kudou Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established by the merger of Kudou, Oota, Uekotan, and Yunoshiri. In 
1923 (Taishou 12), Kaitorima Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established by the merger of Kaitorima, Hiratanai, and Nagaiso. (See 
the note of Matsumae Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities). 
	In 1955 (Shouwa 30), Taisei Village was established by the 
merger of Kudou and Kaitorima. In 1966 (Shouwa 41), Taisei Town was 
established.
	OLD KITA-HIYAMA TOWN; In 1879 (Meiji 12), an administrative 
office (kochou-yakuba) was established for four villages in Futoro 
county; Futoro [\u592A\u6AD3], Gorota [\u53E4\u6AD3\u591A], Raruishi 
[\u826F\u7460\u77F3], and Udomari [\u9D5C\u6CCA]).
	In 1902 (Meiji 35), the administrative office of Higashi-setana 
[\u6771\u702C \u68DA] village was established. It was separated from 
Setana village.
 	In 1906 (Meiji 39), Futoro Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established by the merger of Futoro, Gorota, Raruishi, and Udomari. In 
the same year, Higashi-setana Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established.
	In 1953 (Shouwa 28), Higashi-setana Town was established. In 
1955 (Shouwa 30), Kita-hiyama Town was established by the merger of 
Higashi-setana Town and Futoro Village.
	OLD SETANA TOWN; In 1879 (Meiji 12), two administrative offices 
(kochou-yakuba) were established for five villages in Setana county; 
Setana, Baikatsu [\u6885\u82B1\u90FD], Nakauta [\u4E2D\u6B4C], Abura 
[\u867B\u7F85], and Shimauta [\u5CF6\u6B4C]).
	In 1897 (Meiji 30), Toshibetsu village (now Imakane Town) was 
separated from Setana village. In 1902 (Meiji 35), Setana Village (2nd-
class municipality) was established by the merger of five villages in 
Setana county.
	In the same year, Higashi-setana village was separated from 
Setana Village. (This means that an administrative office was built in 
Higashi-setana village). In 1919 (Taishou 8), Setana Village (1st-class 
municipality) was established. In 1921 (Taishou 10), Setana Town was 
established.
	The town hall of Setana is located near the mouth of the 
Toshibetsu River (Shiribeshi-toshibetsu River). It used to be the town 
hall of Kita-hiyama Town. National Route 229 (Hiyama-kokudou) runs 
along the Sea of Japan. #3
	National Route 230 (Pirika-kokudou) separates from National 
Route 229 near the town hall and crosses the Oshima Peninsula. 
Formerly, the Setana Line of the Japanese National Railways ran along 
National Route 230. The railway connected Setana Station and Kun-nui 
Station in Oshamanbe Town.
	The Port of Setana has a ferry line to Okushiri island. The 
windmills near the port are the first offshore windmills in the 
country. In the built-up area of the former Setana Town, there was a 
clinic run by Guinko Oguino. She was the first female medical doctor in 
the country. #4
 	Distinctive industries in Setana are fishing, paddy rice 
cultivation, and dairy farming. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = pasture 
2,046 hectares in 2015, paddy rice 1,537, beans (soybeans 353, adzuki 
beans 84, other beans 7), fodder 268, potatoes 153, buckwheat 146, 
sugar beets 64, wheat 48, broccoli 23, spinach 10, orchards 5, 
	(continued) --> radishes 3, melons 1, other vegetables 46+X 
(sweet corn, pumpkins, asparagus), and other grains 11; dairy cows 
2,886 head in 2015. STATISTICS OF FISHERIES = squid (flying squid 618 
tons in 2017, other squid 3), salmon 283, sea urchins 133, octopus 65, 
Pacific cod 46, seaweed (Konbu kelp 26, other seaweed 5), 
	(continued) --> olive flounder 22, atka mackerel 19, right-eye 
flounder 17, yellowtail 16, shellfish (abalone 2, other shellfish 10 
[oysters]), shrimp/prawns 9, sharks 4, puffer fish 2, herring 0, other 
fish 92, and other marine animals 16.
	Local specialties include the rice wine (sake) that is made 
from locally grown rice. #5
  
#1  Among the northernmost, southernmost, easternmost and westernmost 
points of Hokkaidou, the westernend is the most difficult to visit. It 
is the steep cliff of Cape Obana.
	Including small islands, the westernmost point is Oshima-
ooshima island in Matsumae Town, Oshima sub-prefecture. It is an 
uninhabited island. 
	Oota Shrine at Cape Obana is one of the oldest shrines in 
Hokkaidou. It was established around 1441. It is one of the most 
difficult shrines to visit.
	It is located at the top of a rocky mountain. Bears live. 
Visitors are like climbers. They will pray for a safety descent at the 
shrine. Mountaineering was a religion in the past.

#2  On a map published by Takeshirou Matsuura in 1859, Haha-gawa (now 
Baba River) and Setaruheshi-nai are written together (http://
koukita.github.io/touzaiezo/map/).
	Tadashi Okudaira wrote that the upper course of the Baba River 
was called the Setanai River (by World Encyclopedia (T. Okudaira et al. 
(2007)).
	When I asked the town hall, they answered that the Setanai 
River would signify what is now the Toshibetsu River (Shiribeshi-
toshibetsu River), pointing at the Setanai Basho Map (Setanai trading 
place map). The map was drawn in the Ansei period (1855-1860) in the 
Edo era.
	In Hiyama and Oshima sub-prefectures, some river names and 
place names changed from Ainu language to Japanese, because the regions
have a long history of Japanese settlement. These are examples of 
changed names;
	(1) The Baba River in Setana Town (the old name was the Setanai 
River), (2) Hime River in Otobe Town (the old name was the Otohe 
River), and (3) Torizaki River in Mori Town (the old name was the 
Oniushi River). (See Oshamanbe Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 
typical river names in Ainu language.)
	As for the name ``Seta-nai'' (``dog, river'' in Ainu language), 
there is a legend of Ainu like this; ``Once upon a time, large dogs 
came down from the mountains. They were messengers of god. They went 
into the sea and turned into rocks.''
	During a bus excursion, a student heard this from an elderly 
man walking National Route 229; ``During the Okushiri Earthquake in 
1993, tidal waves (tsunami) surrounded Sanbonsugi Rocks and reached 
this highway. After the water subsided, sea urchins and flounders were 
left on the road. 

#3  National Route 229 runs along the coast. It runs inland at the 
border between the former Taisei and Kita-hiayama towns. It detours 
Cape Obana, a sea cliff at the western tip of Hokkaidou island.
	Strange-shaped rocks are located along the coast; Mother Bear 
and Cub Rock, Mammoth Rock, and Raccoon Rock.

#4  Guinko Oguino (1851-1913) was born in Tawarase village (now 
Kumagaya City, Saitama Prefecture). In 1885, she passed medical 
practitioner's examination and opened a clinic of gynecology and 
obstetrics in Yushima, Tokyo. She became the first female medical 
doctor in the country. 
	In 1891, her husband, Yukiyoshi Shikata, started developing 
Immanuel district. Immanual was developed by Christians. The location 
was in what is now Imakane Town, Hiyama sub-prefecture. In 1894, Guinko 
Oguino also moved to Immanuel. Her husband failed in development and 
became a missionary.
	In 1897, she moved to the seaside town Setana and opened a 
clinic. In 1903, she went to Sapporo. She wanted to open a larger 
clinic, however, she was told that her medical technique was 20 years' 
behind. She returned to Setana. In 1905, her husband died. In 1908, she 
returned to Tokyo.
	* * *
	As for a medical doctor, I lived in a teachers' apartment in 
Sapporo. Next to the apartment was a clinic for internal medicine and 
pediatrics. The elderly doctor said; ``I was originally internist. When 
I added pediatrics in tis clinic, my friends scorned me. However, I had 
to raise my children.''
	He was proud that his three sons became medical doctors. When I 
went to the clinic with the influenza, he said; ``The latest machine to 
test the influenza is expensive. The debt remains with my son,,, ha ha 
ha.''
	After his sudden death, one of his sons came from a hospital 
and succeeded the clinic for about a year. Then, the clinic was 
demolished and an apartment was built.

#5  A graduation thesis submitted to Faculty of Letters, Hokkaidou 
University, treated rice wine production in Setana Town. The following 
is an excerpt from it. 
	``The producers of the rice wine are farmers. They cultivate 
paddy rice and brew rice wine. They sell two trade names of sake; 
Guinko-monogatari (Guinko's story) and Yoshiko.
	Guinko-monogatari is made from the brewery rice that is 
cultivated by rice-duck farming method, a kind of organic agriculture. 
Yoshiko is made from Kirara 397, which is a common rice variety for 
eat. (See Uryuu Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture and Pippu Town in 
Kamikawa sub-prefecture for Kirara 397.)
	The producers of the rice wine wanted to use the names Kita-
hiyama (old town's name) and Suisen (daffodils, the town's flower) 
instead of Guinko and Yoshiko, however, those names were already 
trademarked.
	 ``Guinko'' was selected because she was a famous female 
doctor in Setana. ``Yoshiko''was selected because it is a common name 
in the town, such as the wife and mother of the rice wine producers.
	The cultivation of brewery rice is difficult in Hokkaidou. 
The grains of brewery rice are larger than those of ordinary rice. The 
rice wine producers in Setana also use ordinary rice. It is Kirara 397. 
(See Uryuu Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture.)
	* * *
	Hokkaidou's wine is also made from ordinary grapes, such 
as Naiagara. (``Ordinary grapes'' means table grapes in Japan.) Also, 
locally grown mountain grapes (Yama-budou) are used.
	As for the brewery rice variety, Yamada-nishiki is the most 
famous. It has been used for the rice wine made in the Nada region 
(now Hyougo Prefecture, in the central part of Honshuu island). Nada is 
famous for rice wine production.
	The Nada's rice wine was shipped to Ezo (now Hokkaidou) by 
north-bound ships. It is said that the rice wine transported by ship 
tastes better. (See Asahikawa City in Kamikawa sub-prefecture, Mashike 
Town in Rumoi sub-prefecture, and Kuriyama Town in Sorachi sub-
prefecture for rice wine; See Ikeda Town in Tokachi sub-prefecture for 
wine.)

1981-2010), PRECIPI 1,327 MM, SNOW 657 CM; COUNTRY SIGN = SEA COWS.
 
Imakane [i-ma-ka-ne] [\u4ECA\u91D1] is a town in Hiyama sub-prefecture, 
south Hokkaidou (dou-nan). It is located inland in the Oshima 
Peninsula. The area corresponds to the midstream and upstream of the 
Shiribeshi-toshibetsu River, which flows to the Sea of Japan. Local 
residents call it Toshibetsu River. Its downstream is Setana Town.
	The name ``Imakane'' is Japanese. It is derived from two 
pioneers, Toujirou Imamura and Ishirou Kanamori (Ima- and Kane-). Both 
pioneers were graduates of Tokyo Professional School (now Waseda 
University). #1
	In the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain gathered gold dust in the 
upstream of the Shiribetsu-toshibetsu River. In the Meiji period, there 
were agate and manganese mines.
	After the Meiji period, in 1893 (Meiji 26), the two pioneers 
settled in what is now Imakane district. In the same year, a group of 
Christians (Kirisuto-kyou-dantai) settled in Immanuel district. #2
	In 1897 (Meiji 30), the administrative office (kochou-yakuba) 
of Toshibetsu [\u5229\u5225] village was established. The village was 
separated from Setana village.
	In 1906 (Meiji 39), Toshibetsu Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established. In 1929 (Shouwa 4), Toshibetsu Village (1st-class 
municipality) was established. (See the note of Matsumae Town for 1st-
class and 2nd-class municipalities.) In 1947 (Shouwa 22), Imakane Town 
was established. At the time, Toshibetsu was renamed to Imakane.
	The town hall of Imakane and the center of the town are located 
along the middle reaches of the Shiribeshi-toshibetsu River. National 
Route 230 (Pirika-kokudou or Hanaishi-douro) run. #3 #4
	In the past, the Setana Line ran along the Shiribeshi-
toshibetsu River. The railway crossed the Oshima peninsula, connecting 
Setana on the Sea of Japan side and Kun-nui on Uchiura Bay, Pacific 
Ocean side. (Setana Station was located in the former Setana Town. Kun-
nui Station on the Hakodate Main Line is located in Oshamanbe Town).
	Distinctive industries in Imakane are agriculture, animal 
husbandry, and forestry. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = pasture 1,446 
hectares in 2015, paddy rice 1,414, beans (soybeans 376, adzuki beans 
208), potatoes 396, wheat 273, fodder 229, sugar beets 117, 
	(continued) --> buckwheat 69, carrots 32, broccoli 24, barley 
19, tomatoes 13, onions 5, and other grains 24; dairy cows 2,021 head 
in 2015 and hogs and pigs X (concealed).
 	Potatoes are sold with the trade-name ``Imakane-danshaku.'' As 
for animal husbandry, swine farms of Nippon Ham Group are distributed 
in the mountains. #5
	As for sightseeing, Pirika Dam is located near Pirika Pass. The 
dam has a long concrete dyke. It stands out along National Route 230. 
The country sign (gateway sign) of the town is Piiri and Piika, which 
are nicknames for sea cow fossils excavated from the dam construction 
site. #6
 
#1 As for the name ``Imakane,'' the name of the post office is Imagane 
(not Imakane). The name of the former railroad station was Imagane. The 
name on the topographical map by Geographical Survey Institute is 
Imakane.
	Imakane Town's former name was Toshibetsu. It comes from 
``tus-pet'' in Ainu language. It means ``snake (or rope), river.'' Or, 
it comes from ``to-us-pet'' in Ainu language. It mans ``pond, many, 
river.'' Both signified the Shiribeshi-toshibetsu River. 
	The Shiribeshi-toshibetsu River was ranked as the cleanest 
river of the country. The ranking is published in Current Water Quality 
of Class-A Rivers in the Country (Zenkoku-ikkyuu-kasen-no-suishitsu-
genkyou) by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and 
Tourism. (See Rankoshi Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for the 
cleanest rivers.) 

#2  The Christian group settled in Immanuel tried to make their utopia. 
The name ``Immanuel'' means ``God with us'' in Hebrew. It was located 
in what is now Kamioka district. The name ``Kamioka'' means ``god 
hill'' in Japanese.
	The first female doctor in the country, Guinko Oguino, came 
Immanuel, because her husband was a member of the Christian group. (See 
Setana Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for her clinic.)
	On the map published by Takeshiro Matsuura in 1859 (http://
koukita.github.io/touzaiezo/map/), there is a place name written as 
Imanpetsu. It may come from ``i-ma-un-pet'' in Ainu language, which 
means ``it, burn (skewers for grilled fish), exist, river.'' Maybe, the 
Christian group imagined Immanuel from the pronunciation. 
	(Updated in 2024; The place name on the map may be Imashipetsu. 
It may come from ``i-ma-si-pet'' in Ainu language, which means ``it, 
burn, large, river.'' Some Katakana characters are difficult to 
distinguish. It is fun to guess the meaning of place names.)

#3  Hanaishi district is located near Pirika Dam. The name ``hanaishi'' 
is Japanese. It means ``menou'' in Japanese and ``agate'' in English.
Hanaishi was the largest agate mine in the country in the Meiji period. 
The agate was shipped to Fukui Prefecture and carved into ornaments 
(Wakasa-menou-zaku). 
	* * *
	Nowadays, agate is mainly imported from Brazil. When I visited 
Sao Paulo, I entered a souvenir shop. A Japanese man who also was 
looking souvenirs recommended me to buy agate chopstick rests.
	While pointing to various colored chopstick rests, he said, 
``Agate is artificially colored, however, this is natural.'' It was 
brown. He was the president of a construction company and knew various 
things including good restaurants. 

#4  Near the center of Imakane Town, a large loop bridge stands out. 
It continues up to Hikaridai district, which is an agricultural area 
on a hill. The loop bridge looks like an expressway, however, it is an 
agricultural road (Nou-men-douro) that was built using gasoline tax. 
	Nou-men-douro is a rural road that is considered as a 
deduction of gasoline tax for agricultural machinery. Other loop 
bridges in Hokkaidou can be seen in Sunagawa (Sorach sub-prefecture), 
Toyoura (Iburi sub-prefecture), and Asari district in Otaru 
(Shiribeshi sub-prefecture).

#5  Danshaku (baron) is a potato cultivar for eat. It is pouplar as 
well as May-queen. (For processing, the major cultivar is Kona-fubuki.)
	Imakane potatoes have a reputation for quality. The cultivated 
area is not large compared to the municipalities in Tokachi sub-
prefecture. Also, the land per farm in Imakane is smaller than that of 
Tokachi.
	Farmers take time on the small land. In the case of the potato 
cultvation in Imakane, they remove nora-imo (stray potatoes), which 
are the rest of the former harvest and give a bad impact on the next 
cultivation.
	A former high school teacher said; ``Potatoes are cultivated 
after potatoes in south Hokkaidou (dou-nan, including Imakane). 
Potatoes are cultivated in crop rotation in east Hokkaidou (dou-tou, 
including Tokachi).''
	In Tokachi, potatoes are cultivated after sugar beets. Then, 
beans or wheat are cultivated after potatoes. The so-called stray 
potatoes are killed by the cold temperature. However, recently, not all 
stray potatoes are killed because of climate change.
	(See Shihoro Town in Tokachi sub-prefecture for potatoes; See 
Kucchan Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for Danshaku potatoes; See 
Assabu Town in Hiyama for May-queen potatoes.)

#6  The width of Pirika Dam is 1,480 meters. It is the longest concrete 
dam in the country.
	The dam was constructed between 1975 and 1991 at the confluence 
of the three rivers; the Shiribeshi-toshibetsu River, the Pirikabetsu
River, and the Chuushibetsu River.
	The dam was constructed for power generation, irrigation, and 
flood control. The driftwood collected from the dam lake is distributed 
free of charge for personal use, such as for wood-burning stoves and 
gardening.
	Kur [ku-a] Plaza Pirika is located in front of the dam. The 
facility includes a hot spring, a ski resort, and a restaurant. The 
specialty of the restaurant is dam curry. Rice is blocking the curry 
like a dam. (See Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for curry and 
rice.)
	In the upstream of the Pirikabetsu River, there is Okupirika 
hot spring along Prefectural Route 999. The name ``Pirika-betsu'' means 
``beautiful river'' in Ainu language. The Kanji characters for Pirika 
[\u7F8E\u5229\u6CB3] also means ``beautiful, gain, river.''
