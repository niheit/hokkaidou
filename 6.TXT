 -----------------
Sorachi [so-ra-chi] [\u7A7A\u77E5] is a sub-prefecture (``sougou-
shinkou-kyouku'') in central Hokkaidou (``dou-ou''). The area 
corresponds to the middle reaches of the Ishikari River. It is an 
inland sub-prefecture.
 	The name ``Sorachi'' comes from ``so-rapci-pet'' in Ainu 
language. It means ``waterfall, fall many, river.'' It signified the 
waterfall of the Sorachi River. #1
	The climate is of the inland type. Summers are warmer and 
winters are colder than the average of Hokkaidou. The area is located 
in the west of the mountains, therefore, it snows a lot. (In winter, 
wet winds blow from the northwest).
	According to the Koeppen's climate classification, the area is 
classified as Dfb (humid continental, warm summer). In the case of 
Iwamizawa City, the mean annual temperature is 7.6 degrees Celsius 
(average from 1981 to 2010), the mean annual precipitation is 1,163 
millimeters, and the mean annual snowfall is 753 centimeters. #2
 	In 1897 (Meiji 30), Sorachi sub-prefecture (Sorachi-shichou 
[\u7A7A\u77E5\u652F\u5E81]) was established. It covered Sorachi county 
(Sorachi-gun [\u7A7A\u77E5\u90E1]) in Ishikari-no-kuni (Ishikari 
country) [\u77F3\u72E9\u56FD]. (See Ishikari sub-prefecture for 
Ishikari country.)
	In 1899 (Meiji 32), Furano village was moved to Kamikawa sub-
prefecture. (Furano village covered the area what is now Kami-furano 
Village, Naka-furano Village, Furano City, and Minami-furano Town). In 
2010, Sorachi General Sub-prefectural Bureau (Sorachi-sougou-shinkou-
kyoku) was established.
	These are municipalities in Sorachi sub-prefecture; (1) 
Iwamizawa City 90,145 (population in 2010), (2) Takikawa City 43,170, 
(3) Bibai City 26,034, (4) Fukagawa City 23,709, (5) Sunagawa City 
19,056, (6) Ashibetsu City 16,628, (7) Kuriyama Town 13,340, 
	(continued) --> (8) Akabira City 12,637, (9) Naganuma Town 
11,691, (10) Yuubari City 10,922, (11) Mikasa City 10,221, (12) Nanporo 
Town 8,778, (13) Shin-totsukawa Town 7,249, (14) Naie Town 6,194, (15) 
Yuni Town 5,896, (16) Tsukigata Town 4,859, (17) Utashinai City 4,387, 
	(continued) --> (18) Kami-sunagawa Town 4,086, (19) Numata Town 
3,612, (20) Moseushi Town 3,462, (21) Uryuu Town 3,049, (22) 
Chippubetsu Town 2,730, (23) Urausu Town 2,206, and (24) Hokuryuu Town 
2,193.
 	The sub-prefecture bureau is located in Iwamizawa City. There 
are many cities in this sub-prefecture. They prospered due to coal 
mines in the past.

#1  The origin of the word ``Sorachi (waterfall, fall many, river)'' is 
the same as Takikawa City in Sorachi sub-prefecture. The name 
``Takikawa'' means ``waterfall, river'' in Japanese. The waterfall is 
the Sorachi Great Falls (Sorachi-oo-taki) in Ashibetsu City, Sorachi 
sub-prefecture. 

#2  In the case of Tokyo (Chiyoda Ward; the representative data of 
Japan), the mean annual temperature is 15.4 degrees Celsius (average 
from 1981 to 2010) and the mean annual rainfall is 1,529 millimeters. 
The climate of Tokyo is classified as Cfa (humid subtropical) by 
Koeppen's climate classification.
	As for the coldest month, the mean temperature of Tokyo is 5.2 
degrees Celsius in January. The mean temperature of Iwamizawa is -5.5 
degrees Celsius in January. As for the hottest month, the mean 
temperature of Tokyo is 26.4 degrees Celsius in August. The mean 
temperature of Iwamizawa is 21.3 degrees Celsius in August.
	In Hokkadou, it gets cold after Obon (15th August). In Tokyo, 
it finally gets cooler after the equinox (23rd September). (Cold and 
cool are feelings.)

 -----------------
AREA 81 KM2 (2010), FOREST 1, CULTIVATED 55; COUNTY = SORACHI [\u7A7A
\u77E5]; POP 8,778 (2010), 5,665 (1990); COUNTRY SIGN = POPLAR & RIVER.
 
Nanporo [na-n-po-ro] [\u5357\u5E4C] is a town in Sorachi sub-
prefecture, central Hokkaidou (``dou-ou''). The area is located in the 
south of the Ishikari Plain. It is a small town. It is an inland town.
	The topography is flat. The area is surrounded by the Yuubari 
River to the north, the Kyuu-yuubari River (old Yuubari River) to the 
southeast, and the Chitose River to the west.
 	The name ``Nanporo'' means ``south, Horomui'' in Japanese. The 
name ``Horomui'' comes from ``poro-moy'' in Ainu language. It means 
``large, bend.'' The original ``Horomui'' is located in Iwamizawa City, 
where the Ishikari River bent. #1
	In 1886 (Meiji 19), ten families immigrated from Niigata 
Prefecture. In 1892 (Meiji 25), land surveying of Horomui wilderness 
(Horomui-guen-ya) was finished. A group of eighty families from Miyagui 
Prefecture (Miyagui-dantai) and a group of fifty families from Mie 
Prefecture (Mie-dantai) immigrated.
	In 1895 (Meiji 28), the administrative office (``kochou-
yakuba'') of Horomui village was established. It was separated from 
Kurisawa village (now Iwamizawa City). In 1909 (Meiji 42), Horomui 
[\u5E4C\u5411] Village (2nd-class municipality) was established. #2
	In 1962 (Shouwa 37), Minami-horo [\u5357\u5E4C] Town was 
established. The name was changed from Horomui to Minami-horo. In 1968 
(Shouwa 43), the pronunciation of the Kanji characters was changed 
from Minami-horo to Nanporo. #3
 	The town hall of Nanporo is located near the Kyuu-yuubari River 
(old Yuubari River). National Route 337 (Douou-kokudou) runs. The 
national highway bends as a crank along Colonial Rectangular Land 
Division (Shokuminchi-kukaku). (See Shin-totsukawa Town in Sorachi sub-
prefecture for Colonial Rectangular Land Division.)
 	A straight road that cuts through Colonial Rectangular 
Division is the former site of the Yuubari Railway. It connected 
Yuubari Station in Yuubari City and Nopporo Station in Ebetsu City. 
(Nopporo Station is on the Hakodate Main Line.)
	The trains shipped coal from the Yuubari mountains and 
agricultural products from Nanporo. There were Nanporo Station and 
Bansui Station in Nanporo Town. #4
	Nanporo is within a commuting zone of Sapporo City. The 
distance is 35 kilometers and the time is 41 minutes by car from the 
town hall of Nanporo to Sapporo Station (by an internet route search in 
2019). The population increased in the 1990s.
	Distinctive industry in Nanporo is agriculture on paddy fields.
STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 2,343 hectares in 2015, wheat 
1,678, beans (soybeans 452, adzuki beans 104, other beans 6), sugar 
beets 109, green onions 60, cabbage 55, broccoli 40, buckwheat 37, 
	(continued) --> fodder 21, onions 17, pasture 11, tomatoes 8, 
watermelons 7, potatoes 5, flowers 4, radishes 1, Chinese cabbages 1, 
other vegetables 71+X (pumpkins, sweet corn), and other grains 55; 
dairy cows X (concealed) head in 2015.
	As for sightseeing, Nanporo Hot Spring opened in 1993. The 
restaurant of the hot spring serves cabbage mega-tendon (cabbage large 
tempura bowl). Cabbage is a local specialty. #5
  	The area is surrounded by rivers. In the past, floods were 
frequent. From the Meiji period to the Shouwa period, flood control 
works were undertaken and farmland expanded. The downstrem of the 
Yuubari River is an artificial drainage. That was dug towards a 
chimney in Ebetsu. #6 #7

#1  The bend of the Ishikari River became an ox-bow lake. (``Ox-bow 
lake'' is called ``mikazuki-ko [crescent moon lake]'' in Japanese.)
The watercourse of the Ishikari River was straghtened to prevent flood 
damages.

#2  In Hokkaidou, there were 1st-class (``ikkyuu'') and 2nd-class 
(``nikyuu'') municipalities from 1899 to 1943. The Hokkaidou government 
subsidized 2nd-class municipalities. It was a pioneering period.

#3  In 1962, the name was changed from Horomui to Minami-horo, because 
there was the same name ``Horomui'' in Iwamizawa City. Horomui still 
exists in Iwamizawa City. There is Horomui Station on the Hakodate 
Main Line.
	In 1968, the name was changed from Minami-horo to Nanporo, 
because the pronunciation of the Kanji characters is difficult. 
``Nanporo'' is similar to Sapporo. Pronunciation of Kanji characters 
is difficult but interesting.

#4  As for the name ``Bansui [\u6669\u7FE0],'' according to the book 
``Minami-horo-chou-shi (Minami-horo Town History)'' published in 1962, 
the place was originally called Banguesou. In the past, the Panke-souka 
River and the Penke-souka River flew. The name ``Panke-souka'' changed 
to ``Bangesou,'' and then to ``Bansui.''
	The Panke-souka River and Penke-souka River were tributaries of 
the Ebetsu River. In Ainu language, ``panke'' means downstream, 
``penke'' means upstream, ``so'' means waterfall, and `ka'' means 
riverbank.
	The Ebetsu River was located downstream from the confluence of 
the old Yuubari River and the Chitose River. The Ebetsu River met the 
Ishikari River in Ebetsu City. The Ebetsu River became the Chitose 
River after the completion of the new Yuubari River. River courses were 
altered to prevent flooding.

#5  Cabbage and lettuce are leaf vegetables (you-sai [\u8449\u83DC]). 
Both are Western vegetables (you-sai [\u6D0B\u83DC]). The planted area 
of cabbage in Hokkaidou is 1,385 hectares (by 2015 Census of 
Agriculture). The planted area of lettuce in Hokkaidou is 601 hectares.
	The largest cabbage producing municipality in Hokkaidou is 
Wassamu Town (147 hectares). The largest lettuce producing municipality 
is Date city (75 hectares).
	Cabbage has a longer history than lettuce in the country. 
Cabbages has been cultivated since the Meiji period (150 years ago). 
Before World War II, cabbages were cultivated mainly in Hokkaidou and 
the Touhoku region. They grow well in cool temperatures.
	Cabbage is eaten raw or boiled. Lettuce is eaten raw. Lettuce 
cultivation spread after the 1970s. Lettuce tastes bitter and the 
taste pairs will with meat. My mother liked cabbage than lettuce. She 
boiled cabbage. In the past, raw vegetables could have worms 
(nematodes).
	Lettuce is a member of chrysanthemum family (``Asteraceae''). 
Cabbage is a member of rape family (``Brassicaceae''). The rape family 
plants produce cross-shaped flowers (juuji-bana), although cabbage 
rarely flowers.
	Radish is a member of rape family as well as cabbage. Radish 
flowers in unkempt vegetable gardens. Radish and cabbage become 
inedible once they flower. The status is called tou-ga-tatsu and means 
that the flower stalk stands or it becomes old.

#6  The downstream of the Yuubari River is an artificial drainage. It 
was constructed between 1922 and 1936. Today, the Yuubari River joins 
the Ishikari River. The Kyuu-yuubari River (old Yuubari River) is 
narrow and meandering and joins the Chitose River. The topography is 
flat. 
	Peat covered vast areas and the land was poorly drained. Once 
a major flood occurred, it took 10 days for the water to recede. Floods 
caused severe damage to crops.
	In the past, when floods started, local residents gathered on 
both sides of the river. They watched the water. When the embankment 
broke, the residents on the other side shouted ``banzai.'' (``banzai'' 
means ``ten thousand years!'' in Japanese. It signifies ``cheers!'') 
The Banzai-embankment existed 100 years ago.

#7  Motoji Hobara was the engineer who worked for the Hokkaidou 
Government after graduating from Tokyo Imperial University (now the 
University of Tokyo). He led the flood control projects of the Yuubari 
River from 1910 (Meiji 43). (Motoji Hobara --> http://ja.wikipedia.org/
wiki/%E4%BF%9D%E5%8E%9F%E5%85%83%E4%BA%8C)
	One day, he climbed a hill in Kuriyama. He saw a tall chimney 
of a paper mill in Ebetsu and thought, ``If we build a straight 
drainage to the Ishikari River, the watercourse of the Yuubari River 
will be shorten from 10.5 ri to 3 ri. The chimney is the landmark.'' 
(One ``ri'' is four kilometers in the Meiji period.)
	Due to the poor economic condition of the nation, the 
construction of watercourse was postponed until 1922 (Taishou 11). 
However, the construction did not progressed. Motoji Hobara and local 
residents submitted petitions to the national government. In 1934 
(Shouwa 9), the dredger ``Shouwa-gou'' was transferred from the 
Toyohira River to the Yuubari River. Then, the construction progressed.
	In 1936 (Shouwa 11), amidst the cheers of local residents, the 
new watercourse of the Yuubari River opened. That is the downstream of 
the current Yuubari River. Then, Motoji Hobara retired the Hokkaidou 
Government. He dedicated his life to the Yuurabri River. (by the book 
``Yuubari-gawa-chisui-shi-ryaku [Yuubari River water control history 
brief]'' published by Nanporo Town in 1994.)
	At Yoshitsune Shrine (now Nanporo Shrine), Flood Control 
Thanksgiving Festival (Chisui-kansha-sai) is held on July 1st. There is 
a statue of Motoji Hobara in the shrine. July 1st was the holiday of 
Nanporo Town. In neighboring Naganuma Town, Water Festival (Mizu-
matsuri) is held on July 2nd at Naganuma Shrine.

Naganuma [na-ga-nu-ma] [\u9577\u6CBC] is a town in Sorachi sub-
prefecture, central Hokkaidou (``dou-ou''). It is an inland town. The 
Ishikari Plain occupies most of the area. The topography is flat.
	The Chitose River, the Kyuu-yuubari River (old Yuubari River), 
and the Maoi [\u99AC\u8FFD] Hills make borders with other 
municipalities. #1 #2
	The name ``Naga-numa'' means ``long, pond'' in Japanese. It is 
a translation of ``tanne-to'' in Ainu language, which means ``long, 
pond.'' There were many ox-bow lakes. They were reclaimed. (``Ox-bow 
lake'' is called ``mikazuki-ko'' in Japanese, which means ``crescent 
moon lake.'')
	In 1887 (Meiji 20), Japanese immigration started. In 1892 
(Meiji 25), the name ``Naganuma'' was decided. In 1893 (Meiji 26), 
Colonial Rectangular Land Division (Shokumin-chi-kukaku) were set in 
Naganuma, and many immigrants moved there. (See Shin-totsukawa Town 
in Sorachi sub-prefecture for Colonial Rectangular Land Division.) #3
	In 1895 (Meiji 28), the administrative office (``kochou-
yakuba'') of Naganuma village was established. It was separated from 
Yuni village. In 1902 (Meiji 35), Naganuma Village (2nd-class 
municipality) was established.
	In 1907 (Meiji 40), Naganuma Village (1st-class municipality) 
was established. In 1952 (Shouwa 27), Naganuma Town was established. 
(See the note of Nanporo Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class 
municipalities.)
	The town hall of Naganuma is located along the Maoi Canal 
(Maoi-unga), which is a tributary of the Kyuu-yuubari River. National 
Route 337 (Douou-kokudou) runs. In the past, the Yuubari Railroad ran. 
It was operated by Hokutan (Hokkaidou Colliery and Steamship).
 	On the former Yuubri Railroad, there were Futaba Station, Kita-
naganuma Station, and Chuuou-noushi-mae Station. Kita-naganuma Station 
was located in Kita-shigai-chi (north built-up area). ``Chuuou-noushi-
mae'' means ``in front of Central Agricultural Experiment Station.''
	Distinctive industries in Naganuma are agriculture and rural 
tourism (green tourism). STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = wheat 2,752 
hectares in 2015, beans (soybeans 2,449, adzuki beans 38, other beans 
4), paddy rice 2,252, buckwheat 309, onions 301, pasture 297, potatoes 
112, green onions 90, sugar beets 64, flowers 64, Chinese cabbage 51, 
	(continued) --> fodder 42, tomatoes 41, orchards 33 (apples 14, 
cherries 4, grapes 1, other fruits 12+X), lettuce 13, spinach 5, 
carrots 4, cucumbers 4, strawberries 3, other vegetables 190+X (sweet, 
corn, pumpkins), other grains 31, and other industrial crops 3; dairy 
cows 774 head in 2015 and hens 2,400.
	In the past, floods occurred frequently. After 1910 (Meiji 43), 
the Naganuma Irrigation Canal (Naganuma-yousui) was developed and paddy 
fields spread. In 1966, the head office of Hokkaidou Agricultural 
Experiment Station was moved from Sapporo to Naganuma. In 1987, 
Naganuma Hot Spring opened. #4
  	Naganuma is near to Sapporo City and Chitose City. The 
population is maintained. Rural tourism thrives. #5

#1  The current Yuubari River meets the Ishikari River. The downstream 
of the Yuubari River is an artificial drainage. It was constructed 
to prevent flooding. In the past, the Yuubari River meandered and 
merged with the Chitose River. The old watercourse is the Kyuu-yuubari 
River (old Yuubari River). (See Nanporo Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture 
for the Yuubari River.)

#2  As for the Maoi Hills (Maoi-kyuuryou), the highest peak is Mt. 
Umaoi-yama (275 meters). The name ``maoi'' comes from ``maw-o-i'' in 
Ainu language. It means ``Hamanasu (Ramanas rose), many, place.''
	The second peak is Mt. Choukan-yama (254 meters). The name 
``choukan'' means ``chief secretary'' in Japanese. The chief secretary 
of the Hokkaidou Government, Chiaki Watanabe, climbed the peak in 1891 
(Meiji 24). Those peaks are the border between Naganuma Town and Yuni 
Town. (Chiaki Watanabe --> http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/
%E6%B8%A1%E8%BE%BA%E5%8D%83%E7%A7%8B)

#3  However, many of the early immigrants left because of floods. More 
than 70 floods occurred after the establishment of Naganuma village. 
(by Katsuhiko Yamashita in T. Okudaira et al. (2007).)
	Today, paddy fields extends in the Ishikari Plain. The Ishikari 
Plain is one of the most argest paddy rice producing centers in the 
country. People do not consume much rice today. Farmers cultivate wheat 
and beans than rice.
	About 100 years ago, people ate proso millet (ina-kibi) 
harvested from reclaimed land. Rice was their dream.
  
#4  These are agricultural experiment stations (nougyou-shiken-jou) run 
by the Hokkaidou Government;
	(1) Central Agricultural Experiment Station in Naganuma Town, 
Sorachi sub-prefecture. It is the head office of agricultural stations 
run by the Hokkaidou Government. It breeds soybean, potatoe, and apple 
varieties.
	It was moved from Sapporo City, Ishikari sub-prefecture. The 
former site of the agricultural experiment station is Noushi-kouen 
(Agricultural Experiment Station Park) in Nishi Ward, Sappro City.
	In Nishi Ward, there also was an agricultural experment station 
run by the national government. It was moved to Hitsujiga-oka district, 
Toyohira Ward, Sapporo City.
	(2) Iwamizawa Agricultural Experiment Station in Iwamizawa 
City, Sorachi sub-prefecture. It breeds paddy rice varieties. It bred 
``Nanatsu-boshi.'' (See Iwamizawa City in Sorachi sub-prefecture.)
	(3) Genetic Resources Division is located in Takikawa City, 
Sorachi sub-prefecture. It preserves seeds.
	(4) Flower and Vegetable Technical Center in Takikawa City, 
Sorachi sub-prefecture. It bred ``Kita-kirari (variety of lily for 
floriculture) and ``Yume-temari (variety of melon). (See Makkari Town 
in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for lily bulb.)
	(5) Kamikawa Agricultural Experiment Station in Pippu Town, 
Kamikawa sub-prefecture. It breeds paddy rice varieties. It bred 
``Yume-pirika,'' ``Hoshi-no-yume,'' and ``Kirara 397.''
	(6) Tokachi Agricultural Experiment Station in Memuro Town, 
Tokachi sub-prefecture. It breeds bean varieties. It bred ``Yuki-homare 
(soybean)'' and ``Kita-roman (adzuki bean).''
	(7) Kitami Agriculutral Experiment Station in Kunneppu Town, 
Okhotsk sub-prefecture. It breeds wheat, potato, onion, and grass 
(pasture) varieties. It bred ``Kita-honami (winter wheat),'' ``Saya-
akane (potato),'' ``Sarari (onion),'' and ``Natsu-sakari (timothy).'' 
The ear of timothy is resemble neko-jarasi (which means ``cat mess'' in 
Japanese or ``green foxtail'' in English).
	(8) Animal Husbandry Experiment Station in Shintoku Town, 
Tokachi sub-prefecture.
	(9) Dairy Farming Experiment Station in Naka-shibetsu Town,

	(10) Tenpoku Branch of Dairy Farming Experiment Station in 
Hama-tonbetsu Town, Souya sub-prefecture.
	(11) Dounan Agriculutural Experiment Station in Hokuto City, 
Oshima sub-prefecture. It breeds vegetable and paddy rice varieties. It 
bred ``Kentarou (strawberry)'' and `Fukkurinko (paddy rice).''
	Strawberries are included in the vegetable category in Japanese 
statistics. In Canada, strawberries are included in the fruit category  
(by T. Nihei et al. 2020. Agricultural regions in the province of 
British Columbia, Canada. ``Geographical Studies'' http://
www.researchgate.net/publication/342432003).

#5  Rural tourism is called agri-tourism or green-toursim in Japan. 
Several graduate theses from Faculty of Letters at Hokkaidou University 
dealt with agri-tourism in Naganuma.
	School children from urban areas stay in farms. They experience 
farming. (Mothers expect their children to be strong both mentally and 
physically through agri-tourism. However, that will not happen in a 
two-day stay.)
	Professor Tooru Ikeda at Hokkaidou University said, ``The 
origin of rural tourism was Germany.'' It was for injured soldiers 
(shou-hei [\u50B7\u5175]) during World War I. They injured physically 
and mentally and went to the countryside.
	Wandervogel movement (going-to-nature movement) also started in 
Germany. Westerners have a unique culture of love for nature. The 
culture is now based on possibilism. It is like a top-down perspective.
	* * *
	A student from Italy said, ``Pilgrimage is the base of rural 
tourism.'' In the feudal era, it was difficult to travel across 
countries. In the case of Japan, during the Edo era, people organized 
religious groups such as Ise-kou and traveled.
	``Ise-kou'' means a religious study group of Ise Shrine. The 
members of the group could travel to Ise Shrine. (Ise Shrine is 
locate in Mie Prefecture.) The travel was religious and touristic.
	Recently, even Hawaii-kou was organized. Elderly people in a 
village organized Hawaii-kou, studied about Hawaii, and traveled to 
Hawaii. (by Morimoto et al. 1998. Changes in the livelihood of suburb 
mountain village in Hitachi-oota City. ``Chiiki-chousa-houkoku''

Yuni [yu-ni] [\u7531\u4EC1] is a town in Sorachi sub-prefecture, 
central Hokkaidou (``dou-ou''). It is an inland town. The area includes 
the Maoi Hills to the west and the Yuubari River to the east.
 	The name ``Yuni'' comes from  ``yu-un-i'' in Ainu language. It 
means ``hot spring, exist, place.'' Or, it comes from ``i-un-i'' in 
Ainu language. It means ``snake, exist, place.'' Both signified the 
Yuni River. There was a hot spring along the river.
	In 1891 (Meiji 24), a group of 119 people from Kumamoto 
Prefecture (Kumamoto-dantai) immigrated. In 1892 (Meiji 25), the 
administrative office (``kochou-yakuba'') of Yuni village was 
established. 
	In the same year, The Hokkaidou Colliery Railway opened (now 
the Muroran Main Line). Yuni Station became a transportation hub for 
neighboring settlements.
	In 1893 (Meiji 26), the administrative office of Yuni and 
other three villages was established. It covered Yuni village, Kadota 
village (now Kuriyama Town), Noborikawa village (now Yuubari City), and 
Naganuma village (now Naganuma Town).
	In 1895 (Meiji 28), the administrative office of Naganuma 
village was separated. In 1897 (Meiji 30), the administrative office of 
Noborikawa was separated. In 1900 (Meiji 33), the administrative office 
of Kakuta was separated.
 	In 1902 (Meiji 35), Yuni Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established. In 1919 (Taishou 8), Yuni Village (1st-class municipality)
was established. In 1950 (Shouwa 25), Yuni Town was established. (See 
the note of Nanporo Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.)
	The town hall of Yuni is located to the north. Near the town 
hall, the Yuni River meets the Yuubari River. National Route 234 (Yuni-
kokudou) and the Muroran Main Line pass three built-up areas; Yuni, 
Furusan, and Mikawa. #1
 	National Route 274 (Mikawa-kokudou) and the Sekishou Line pass 
through the south of the town. They run along Ryuusen-kyou Gorge on the 
Yuubari River. The gorge was created by the erosion of the Yuubari 
River and the uplift of the Yuubari Mountains.
	Distinctive industries in Yuni are agriculture and sightseeing.
STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 1,998 hectares in 2015, wheat 
1,041, beans (soybeans 519, adzuki beans 129, other beans 21), pasture 
242, sugar beets 233, fodder 231, potatoes 213, onions 107, buckwheat 
26, yams 16, carrots 10, cabbage 10, broccoli 9, orchards 8 (apples 7),
	(continued) --> flowers 6, melons 4, green onions 3, Chinese 
cabbage 2, tomatoes 2, water melons 1, other vegetables 131+X 
(pumpkins, sweet corn, burdock), other grains 35, and other industrial 
crops 10; dairy cows 1,691 head in 2015.
	A dam stands out when we move on the expressway. It is the 
Kawabata Dam. It built over the Yuubari River for irrigation and power 
generation. (The Yuubari River is the border between Yuni Town 
and Kuriyama Town. See Yuubari City in Sorachi sub-prefecture for the 
Yuubari River.)
	The Oo-yuubari Dam and the Kawabata Dam were completed in 1962. 
Upland fields in Yuni Town were turned into paddy fields. Today, 
Shiitake mushroom production thrives too. #2
	As for sightseeing, these are tourist attractions; (1) Yuni 
Garden, including a large English garden, (2) a tourist herb garden, 
(3) Yun-ni Hot Spring, which opened in 1993, (4) Yumekku-kan, which is 
a library and exhibition facility, displaying mammoth and bighorn deer, 
and (5) centipede race festival, which is printed on the country sign.
	On a bus excursion, we traveled from Kuriyama Town to Yuni 
Garden. Along the route, we passed a straight road that cuts through 
the Maoi Hills. It was like a road in the USA. The Yarikirenai River 
near the straight road was also popular among young students. #3 #4

#1  The name ``Furusan [\u53E4\u5C71]'' comes from ``fur-sam'' in Ainu 
language. It means ``hill, neighbor.'' The name ``Mikawa [\u4E09
\u5DDD]'' was named by immigrants from Mikawa-no-kuni (Mikawa [\u4E09
\u6CB3] country) in Aichi Prefecture. They applied a different Kanji 
character so as not to tarnish the reputation of their hometown. The 
development was so hard that it would not succeed.
	According to the ``Yuni-chou-shi (Yuni Town history)'' 
published in 1994; ``During the pioneering days, many Akadamo tress 
grew. Logs of Akadamo were laid on the lowlands. They allowed horse-
drawn carriages to pass.'' Akadamo is also called ``Harunire'' in 
Japanese. It is ``Japanese elm'' in English.

#2  Before the construction of the two dams, the Yuubari River 
frequently flooded frequently. Today, farmers cultivate delicious rice 
because the soil contains minerals of river sand and the land is well- 
drained. (See Uryuu Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for delicious rice.)

#3  During an excursion, when the bus entered the straight road, 
students said, ``Wow!'' It is ``Yuni Town Hakken-sen (8-ken [15 meters] 
width road).''
	The road was built by Yamagata-dantai (an immigrant group from 
Yamagata Prefecture). They moved in 1897 (Meiji 30). The road was built 
in parallel with the Muroran Main Line, which opened in 1892 (Meiji 
25). I think, the pioneers wanted to build a long and straight road on 
the large island.
	In Yuni Town, there are no Colonial Rectangular Division 
(Shokuminchi-kukaku), which provide straight roads in Hokkaidou. The 
straight road in Yuni Town is isolated. The nearest Colonial 
Rectangular Land Division is located in Naganuma Town, on the other 
side of the Maoi Hills. (See Shin-totsukawa Town in Sorachi sub-
prefecture for Colonial Rectangular Land Division.)
 	Japan is a mountainous country. Roads curve with topography. 
Straight roads are unusual. Newly developed places have straight roads. 
For example, (1) Hokkaidou, which was developed mainly after the Meiji 
period, and (2) Shinden on Musashino Plateau, which was developed after 
the mid Edo era. (``Shinden'' means ``new, field'' in Japanese.)
	After motorization, rural roads became straighter and wider. 
Traditional villages in Honshuu island still have narrow roads if the 
soil is fertile.
	* * *
	These are famous straight roads in Hokkadou; (1) Yuni Town 
Hakken-sen, which cuts the Maoi Hills in Sorachi sub-prefecture, (2) 
slopes descending to Hakodate Bay, Hakodate City, Oshima sub-
prefecture, 
	(continued) --> (3) National Route 12, which runs on the flat 
Ishikari Plain (See Bibai City, Naie Town, and Takikawa City in Sorachi 
sub-prefecture), (4) The Road to Heaven (Tengoku-e-no-michi) in Shari 
Town, Okhotsk sub-prefecture, and (5) many other roads you will see in 
Hokkaidou.
	In pioneering years, a straight line for making a straight 
road was set at night. Torches were lit and a straight line was set.
	* * *
	As for straight railroads, the longest section in the country 
is between Tomakomai City and Shiraoi Town. The second is between 
Bibai City and Takikawa City, which runs along National Route 12. The 
third is located on Musashino Plateau in Tokyo Prefecture. (See 
Tomakomai City in Iburi sub-prefecture for straight railroads.)
	On a straight road of Hokkaidou Unversity, I heard students 
said, ``Hokkaidou wa dekkkai-dou (Hokkadou is big).'' (See Hokkaidou 
for dekkai-dou.)
	* * *
	Not only roads and railroads, but also rivers were straightened 
such as the Ishikari River and the Yuubari River to prevent flooding.
Students from Canada and the USA said, ``Japanese rivers are 
concreted. It is not natural. It is a pity.''
	We live here. We prevent flooding. On the other hand, students 
from South Asia, including the mouths of the Gungis and Bramaputra 
(Jamuna), admired the concreted riverbanks and cliffs.

#4  The name ``Yarikirenai'' sounds like ``I cannot stand it any 
more!'' in Japanese. Young students like the phrase. An old proverb 
says, ``Young people worry (Nayameru-wakamono).'' I edited a book 
about worry (T. Nihei ed. 2017. ``People worry.'' Hokkaidou University 
Press. ISBN 9784832934009). Worrying is the privilege of young people.
	The pioneers near the Yarikirenai River suffered from flood 
damages. They were disappointed and called it ``Yarikirenai'' (by Yuni 
Town's web-page).
	The name ``Yarikirenai'' comes from ``yanke-nai'' in Ainu 
language. It means ``no fish, stream.'' They were also disappointed. 
(See Oshamanbe Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for funny river names.)

Iwamizawa [i-wa-mi-za-wa] [\u5CA9\u898B\u6CA2] is a city in Sorachi 
sub-prefecture, central Hokkaidou (``dou-ou''). The area extends from 
the east bank of the Ishikari River to the Yuubari Mountains. The 
Ikushunbetsu River, the Horomui River, and the Kyuu-bibai River flow.
 	The name ``Iwamizawa'' comes from ``yuami-sawa [\u6D74\u6FA4]'' 
in Japanese. It means ``bathe, stream.'' In pioneering years, there was 
an inn for road construction. Workers could bathe there. The inn was 
located along the Ikushunbetsu River.
 	In 1882 (Meiji 15), Iwamizawa Station on the Horonai Line (now 
part of the Hakodate Main Line) opened. In 1884 (Meiji 17), 277 
families, 1,503 people, immigrated. They came mainly from Yamaguchi 
Prefecture and Tottori Prefecture. The administrative office (``kochou-
yakuba'') of Iwamizawa [\u5CA9\u898B\u6FA4] village was established.
	In 1892 (Meiji 25), the administrative office of Kurisawa 
[\u6817\u6FA4] village was established. It was separated from Iwamizawa 
village. The Hokkaidou Colliery Railway (now the Muroran Main Line) 
opened.
  	In 1900 (Meiji 33), Iwamizawa Village (1st-class municipality) 
was established with a population of 10,284 (by Iwamizawa City). The 
administrative office of Kitamura [\u5317\u6751] village was 
established. It was separated from Iwamizawa. (See the note of Nanporo 
Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.)
	In 1906 (Meiji 39), Iwamizawa Town was established with a 
population of 19,812. Kurisawa Village (2nd-class municipalities) was 
established. In 1919 (Taishou 8), Kitamura Village (2nd-class 
municipality) was established. 
	In 1943 (Shouwa 18), Iwamizawa [\u5CA9\u898B\u6CA2] City 
was established with a population of 35,348. In 2006, Iwamizawa City 
merged Kurisawa Town and Kitamura Village. #1 #2
 	The city hall of Iwamizawa and Sorachi sub-prefecture bureau 
are located between the Ikushunbetsu River and the Horomui River. The 
former Iwamizawa Shrine was located along the Ikushunbetsu River. That 
is the original location of the settlement.
	The Hakodate Main Line and National Route 12 (Chuuou-kokudou) 
run. The Muroran Main Line and National Route 234 (Yuni-kokudou) 
terminate near the city hall.
	Iwamizawa was developed as a junction of railways in the Meiji 
period. The built-up area was known as ``Haikara (high collar),'' which 
means modern. Gas lamps illuminated in Iwamizawa for the first time 
in Hokkaidou. #3 #4 #5
	Distinctive industries in Iwamizawa are manufacturing, 
agriculture, commerce, and sightseeing. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = 
paddy rice 7,496 hectares in 2015, wheat 4,903, beans (soybeans 1,335,

 	The planted area of paddy rice is the largest in Hokkaidou. The 
delicious rice variety ``Nanatsu-boshi'' was bred in Iwamizawa. As for 
manufacturing, there are seven industrial parks. Food processing is
thriving. Commerce is also thriving as the center of Sorachi sub-
prefecture. #6 #7 #8
	As for sightseeing, a large Ferris wheel can be seen from the 
express way. It is Hokkaidou Greenland. The Ferris wheel is the largest 
in Hokkaido. The height is 85 meters. It used to be Mitsui Coal Mine 
amusement park. There were many children.
	The former country sign (gateway sign) of Iwamizawa was 
horses. The design remineded me of the power of horses. It signified 
the daft horse racing (ban-ei-keiba). There wasa racetrack for draft 
horses. (See Obihiro City in Tokachi sub-prefecture for draft horse 
racing.)

#1  As for the former Kurisawa Town, the name ``Kuri-sawa'' means 
``chestnut, stream'' in Japanese. It is a translation of ``yam-o-nay'' 
in Ainu language, which means ``chestnut, many, stream.'' There were 
many chestnut trees. (See Kuriyama Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for 
chestnut tree.)
	Coal mines operated in the Yuubari Mountains in the former 
Kurisawa Village. Those were Manji Coal Mine and Miruto Coal Mine. Coal 
was transported by the Manji Line, which was run by the Japanese 
National Railways (Kokutetsu). The railway operated from 1914 to 1985. 
(See Yuubari City in Sorachi sub-prefecture for coal mine.)
	In the former Kurisawa Town, there is the Kuttari Hills [\u4E45
\u6A3D]. The name ``Kuttari'' comes from ``kuttar-us-i'' in Ainu 
language. It means ``Itadori (Japanese knotweed), many, place.''
	As for Itadori, its old Japanese name is Kojou. The place name 
``Kojou-hama'' in Shiraoi Town, Iburi sub-prefecture, is the same 
meaning as Kuttari. ``Ko-jou'' in Japanese means ``tiger skin, cane.''
	The stem of Itadori is dotted and looks like tiger skin. In the 
past, large grasses such as Itadori and Akaza (fat hen) were processed 
into canes.
	In Hokkaidou, Itadori generally means Oo-itadori (large 
Itadori, ``Reynoutria sachalinensis''). In the forest of Hokkaidou 
University, Oo-itadori grows to a height of 3 meters. The stems of 
Itadori and Oo-itadori are hollow. At kindergartens near mountains, 
children play with flutes made from Oo-itadori.

#2  As for the former Kitamura Village, the name comes from Yuuji 
Kitamura, who established a large farm (480 hectares). He came from 
Yamanashi Prefecture. (The place name does not mean ``north, village 
[kita, mura].'')
	Place names in the former Kitamura Village are Japanese. This 
is because; (1) There were no Ainu villages in the area, (2) The 
topography is flat and has no specific features.
 
#3  During an excursion, I heard that the first gas lamp in Hokkkaidou 
was installed in Iwamizawa. According to the ``Iwamizawa-no-minwa 
(Folk-tales of Iwamizawa)'' http://www.dokayuki.gr.jp/minwa/burei.html; 
	``Iwamizawa Station was relocated to the current place in 1892 
(Meiji 25). Tamura-ryokan (Tamura-inn) in front of the Station had gas 
lamps.'' (However, it does not write when the gas lamps were 
installed.)
	According to the ``Hokkaidou Gas 100-nen-shi (Hokkaidou Gas 
centennial history)'' published in 2012, Hokkaidou Gas company's first 
gas lamps were installed in Sapporo, Otaru, and Hakodate in 1912 (Meiji 
45).
	The first gas lamp in the country was installed in Yokohama in 
1872 (Meiji 5). Gas lamps are brighter than oil lamps. They were used 
for commercial and public purposes, not for personal use.

#4  In the past, the city of Iwamizawa was advanced. Now, the land 
rices falls. Shops in front of the station are closed. They turned into 
residential houses. National chain stores opened in the suburbs.
	From Iwamizawa to Sapporo, it takes about 40 minutes by train, 
or about 25 minutes by express train, from Iwamizawa to Sapporo. 
Iwamizawa is not a bed-town (suburb) of Sapporo, however, many people 
commute to Sapporo.

#5  Iwamizawa was a traffic hub for coal transportation. Iwamizawa 
Station was the junction of the Hokkaidou Colliery Railway (now the 
Muroran Main Line), the Manji Line, and the Horonai Line (now part of 
the Hakodate Main Line).
	The Horonai Line led to the Port of Otaru on the Sea of Japan 
side. The Hokkaidou Colliery Railway led to the Port of Muroran on the 
Pacific Ocean side.
	The Horonai Line was the third railway opened in the country. 
It connected the stations of Temiya,* Sumiyoshi (now Otaru), Asari, 
Zenibako, Karugawa (now Teine), Kotoni, Sapporo, Shiroishi (now 
Atsubetsu), Nopporo, Ebetsu, Horomui, Iwamizawa, Horonai-puto, and 
Horonai.**
	(* Temiya is located in Otaru City. ** Horonai is located in 
Mikasa City. See Otaru City in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for the 
Horonai Line.)
	The Hokkaidou Colliery Railway connected the stations of 
Muroran, Horobetsu, Noboribetsu, Shiraoi, Tomakomai, Oiwake, Yuni, and 
Iwamizawa. Those railroads were built for coal transportation. The 
railroads in Honshuu island were built for passengers from ports.
	For the opening of railroads in Hokkaidou, American advisors
worked for Hokkaidou Development Commission (Kaitakushi). They were 
Horace Capron, Benjamin Smith Lyman, and Joseph Ury Crawford (See 
Mikasa City in Sorachi sub-prefecture for American advisors.)

#6  The area of paddy rice in Iwamizawa became the largest in Hokkaidou 
after the merger with Kitamura Village. The topography of the former 
Kitamura Vilalge is flat.
	This is the ranking of planted paddy rice area in 2005 (before 
the megrger); Asahikwa City 6,451 (hectares), Fukagawa City 5,999, 
Bibai City 4,700, Naganuma Town 3,469, Shin-totsukawa Town 3,412, 
Kitamura Village 3,161, and Iwamizawa City 3,116.
	These municipalities are located in Sorachi sub-prefecture, 
except for Asahikawa in Kamikawa sub-prefecture. Sorachi sub-prefecture 
is one of the leading rice producing area in the country. It includes 
the Ishikari Plain, the 2nd largest plain. Paddy fields spread after 
drainage canals were built and peatlands were improved.
	In Iwamizawa, wheat is cultivated in paddy fields. Onions are 
cultivated on the natural levees of the Ikushunbetsu River. These 
crops were increased after the enactment of the rice reduction policy 
(``guentan-seisaku'') in the 1970s. (by H. Tano 1993. Locaton of truck 
farming areas in Hokkaidou (3). ''Chiba University of Commerce Review''
31(3) 29-73 HTTP://2242.MOOO.COM/PAPER/2425.PDF)
	Rice prices have been gradually falling after the abolition of 
Food Control Law in 1995. Elderly farmers stopped paddy rice 
cultivation.

#7  The main rice varieties cultivated in Hokkaidou in 2006 are
Nanatsu-boshi (44 percent of the planted area), Kirara 397 (23), and 
Hoshino-yume (14).
	The delicous rice variety ``Nanatsu-boshi'' was bred in 
Iwamizawa Agricultural Experiment Station. The name ``Nanatsu-boshi'' 
is Japanese and means ``seven, star.'' It signifies the Big Dipper on 
the north sky.
	Another delicious rice variety ``Yume-pirika'' is spreading 
today. (See Pippu Town in Kamikawa sub-prefecture for Yume-pirika.) It 
is said that the use of insecticide is low in Hokkaidou because of the 
cold climate. The situation may be changing because of the increase in 
delicious rice cultivation and climate change.
	The rice cultivated in Hokkaidou was not good taste in the 
past. The rice was bred for cold climate resistance. It was said that 
cats would not eat the rice. (See Uryuu Town sub-prefecture for 
delicious rice.)
 
#8  In the early 20th century, drapers (``kimono'' shops) in Iwamizawa 
dealt high-end clothes for the families of Hokkaidou Colliery and 
Steamship (Hokutan). The business was very successful (by Hiraoka 
2001).
	During an excursion, I heard this; ``Wholesalers of electric 
equipment in Iwamizawa supported Kounosuke Matsushita in his youth. His 
company National (now Panasonic) grew significantly. In the high 
economic growth period (from the late 1960s to the early 1970s), 
Iwamizawa became a base of National's television sales.''
	Coal miner's apartments (``tan-juu'' or ``tankou-juutaku'') 
were distributed on the Yuubari Mountains. The demand for televisions 
was high. Turntables and cassette players also sold well.

AREA 204 KM2 (2010), FOREST 111, CURLTIVATED 55; COUNTY = YUUBARI 
[\u5915\u5F35]; POP 13,340 (2010), 16,101 (1990); COUNTRY SIGN = 
BUTTERFLY & MOUNTAIN.
 
Kuriyama [ku-ri-ya-ma] [\u6817\u5C71] is a town in Sorachi sub-
prefecture, central Hokkaiodu (``dou-ou''). The area extends from the 
east bank of the Yuubari River to the Yuubari mountains. It is an 
inland town.
	The name ``Kuriyama'' is Japanese. ``Kuri, yama'' means 
``chestnut, mountain.'' It is a translation of ``yam-ni-us-i'' in Ainu 
language, which means ``chestnut, tree, many, place.'' The 
municipalities of Kuriayama, Kurisawa (now Iwamizawa), and Ebetsu are 
the northern limit of natural chestnut trees. #1
 	In 1888 (Meiji 21), the former samurais from Kakuda Castle in 
the Sendai Domain immigrated. They were seven families, twenty four 
people. In 1892 (Meiji 25), the Hokkaidou Colliery Railway (now the 
Muroran Main Line) opened. In 1893 (Meiji 26), Kuriyama Station opened.
	In 1900 (Meiji 33), the administrative office (``kochou-
yakuba'') of Kakuta [\u89D2\u7530] village was established. (The 
pronunciation is Kakuta not Kakuda.) It was separated from Yuni 
village. In 1902 (Meiji 35), Kakuta Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established. (See the note of Nanporo Town for 1st-class and 2nd-
class municipalities.)
 	In 1907 (Meiji 40), Kakuta Village (1st-class municipality) was 
established. In 1949 (Shouwa 24), Kuriyama Town was established. It was 
renamed from Kakuta. In 1963 (Shouwa 38), the town hall was moved to 
Kuriayama district from Kakuta district.
	The town hall of Kuriyama is located at the confluence of the 
Yuubari River and the Uenbetsu [\u96E8\u7159\u5225] River. National 
Route 234 (Yuni-kokudou) and the Muroran Main Line pass. The old 
Kuriyama Tunnel on the Muroran Line can be seen from National Route 
234. #2 #3
	In the past, the Yuubari Railway ran. Trains transported coal 
and coal miners. It connected Nopporo in Ebetsu City, Minamihoro (now 
Nanporo Town), Kuriyama Town, and Yuubari City from 1926 to 1975.
	Kakuta Coal Mine operated from 1933 to 1970. The population of 
Kuriyama Tow peaked in 1960 at 23,003 (by Population Census). (See 
Yuubari City in Sorachi sub-prefecture for coal mining.)
	National Route 274 (Mikawa-kokudou) and the Sekishou Line pass 
to the south. There is no station on the Sekisou Line. The Kawabata Dam 
over the Yuubari River stands out from the Dou-tou Expressway. It is 
located on the border between Kuriyama and Yuni towns. (See Yuni Town 
in Sorachi sub-prefecture for the dam.)
 	Distinctive industries in Kuriyama are agriculture, 
manufacturing, and sightseeing. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 
1,773 hectares in 2015, wheat 1,280, beans (soybeans 490, adzuki beans 
15, other beans 2), potatoes 214, fodder 52, pasture 44, sugar beets 
30, green onions 29, melons 21, tomatoes 8, orchards 6, flowers 6, 
	(continued) --> strawberries 4, spinach 3, carrots 1, yams 1, 
cucumbers 1, chestnuts 1, other grains 82, and other vegetables 117+X 
(pumpkins); hens 45,200 head in 2015 and dairy cows X (concealed).
	In 1895 (Meiji 28), the first agricultural irrigation 
association (suiri-kumiai) was established. It became a model for paddy 
rice cultivation in Hokkaidou. As for manufacturing, shipments of 
wooden products and earthenware are large.
	As for sightseeing, Kobayashi brewery (Kobayashi-shuzou) is 
located along the Yuubari River. The old buildings including rice wine
warehouses are designated as Tangible Cultural Properties (Yuukei-
bunkazai). Neighboring farmers cultivate brewery rice in summer and 
work for the brewery to make rice wine in winter. #4

#1  As for chestnut, the wood is hard and water resistant. Therefore, 
the wood of chestnut was used to make chests. In Japan, the wood of 
chestnut was used for sleepers of railroads. My father said, ``Kuri 
(chestnut) is hard and good, however, the core of Hinoki (cypress) is 
much harder.''
	Many Japanese think that the word ``marron'' means chestnut in 
English. However, ``marron'' is French. The word ``marronnier'' is also 
French. It means ``horse chestnut'' in English and ``tochi-no-ki'' in 
Japanese. The nut of horse chestnut is similar to the nut of chestnut. 
 
#2  The Muroran Main Line was a double track, when it tranported coal 
to the port of Muroran. One track passed through the old Kuriyama 
Tunnel. The tunnel was built under the Kuttari Hills. The abandoned 
Kuriyama Tunnel resembles to the former Taushubetsu bridge. (See Kami-
shihoro Town in Tokachi sub-prefecture for Taushubetsu bridge, a 
phantom bridge that appears from a river.)
	Near the old Kuriyama Tunnel, there was a weeping tree. It was 
a 300-year-old Harunire (Japanese elm). When road constructors and 
railroad constructors tried to cut down the tree, it wept. Today, 
a stone monument and another tree stand at the site.
	 The wind passing over the valley of the Yuubari river may 
have caused the weep-like sound, or the soul of the dead during the 
tunnel construction may have caused the weep-like sound.
	The road along the Yuubari Mountains was constructed by 
prisoners from Sorachi Prison (Sorachi-shuuchikan), which was located 
in what is now Mikasa City. (See Tsukigata Town in Sorachi sub-
prefecture for prisoner-built roads.)

#3  Hatoyama district is located near the built-up area of Kuriyama. It 
was developed by Kazuo Hatoyama. He was a member of the House of 
Representatives (shuugui-in-gui-in) and the president of Tokyo 
Professional School (now Waseda University).
	Hatoyama Shrine is located in Hatoyama district. Famous people 
became gods (shrines) in the country. For example, General Maresuke 
Nogui became Nogui Shrine in Tokyo.
	Kazuo Hatoyama's great grandson is Yukio Hatoaya. He became the 
first prime minister from Hokkaidou. Although he was born and grown in 
Tokyo, his electoral district (constituency or ``senkyo-ku'') was 
Muroran. Kuriyama and Muroran is connected by rail.
	* * *
	Kyuu Sakamoto memorial hall is located Near the built-up area 
of Kakuta. Kyuu Sakamoto was the only Japanese singer who won the first 
place on Billboard Hot 100 in the USA.
	His song was sung in Japanese even in the USA. It was called 
Sukiyaki song. The original title was ``Ue-wo-muite-arukou (Let's 
walk, looking upwards).'' He died in a jet plane crash in 1984. He 
worked with facilities for people with disabilities in Kuriyama Town 
and Kuromatsunai Town.

#4  Kobayashi brewery uses brewery rice varieties cultivated in 
Kuriyama Town. The names are Guin-puu (``poem, wind'' in Japanese), 
Suisei (comet), and Kita-shizuku (north, dew). Those were bred in 
Hokkaidou.
	The brewery also use ordinal rice variety ``Kirara 397.'' (The 
``ordinal rice'' means the one sold at supermarkets; See Setana Town 
in Hiyama sub-prefecture for brewery rice; See Uryuu Town and Pippu 
Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for Kirara 397.)
	In the past, Kobayashi brewery was located in Sapporo. The 
address was Minami-2, Nishi-4. (Today, the address is a race horse 
ticket shop of JRA [Japan Racing Association].) In 1900 (Meiji 33), 
Kobayashi brewery moved to Kuriayama due to the prosperity of coal 
mining in the Yuubari Mountains.
	The warehouses in Kobayashi brewery, which are designated as 
Tangible Cultural Properties, are made of Sapporo soft stone (Sapporo-
nanseki, welded tuff) and bricks. The rice wine stored in brick i
warehouses does not freeze in winter.
	When coal mines were in operation, Kobayashi brewery made 
10,000 ``koku'' of rice wine per year. (One ``koku'' of rice wine is 
180 liters). Today, the amount is 1,200 ``koku.'' (See Setana Town in 
Hiyama sub-prefecture for one ``koku'' of rice; See Esashi Town in 
Hiyama sub-prefecture for one ``koku'' of herring.)
	In the past, breweries of rice wine hang a large cedar ball in 
front of the shop. The cedar ball is called ``sugui-dama (cedar ball)'' 
in Japanese. When the rice wine of the year was brewed, a cedar ball 
was hung.
	The color of the cedar ball slowly changed from green to brown. 
People came to the shop when the cedar ball turned brown. The taste of 
rice wine was matured.
	(In 2014, I visited a brewery in Canada that sells apple soda 
[apple soda wine]. It sells by weight in glass bottles. I remembered an 
old custom in Japan. In the past, rice wine was sold by weight with 
Tokkuri [pottery bottle for rice wine] [\u5FB3\u5229]. Old Tokkuri can 
be found in old Japanese warehouses.)
	* * *
	In the shop of Kobayashi brewery, the high-end rice wine is 
10,000 yen per 1 shou (1.8 liters). It is brewed from the core of 
brewery rice. The low-end rice wine is 1,700 yen per 1 shou. It is 
brewed from Kirara 397, which is an ordinal rice variety. The low-end 
rice wine retains the taste from the past.
	In the past, barrels were made of wood. The material was cedar 
tree. The flavor of the wood was transferred to rice wine. Therefore, 
the rice wine producers (touji) made it with a strong taste. It was 
sweeter.
 	Today, rice wine breweries including Kobayashi brewery use 
enamel tanks (grass-lined steel tanks or ``Hourou tank'' in Japanese). 
The taste is light. Japanese people prefer fresh one rather than 
matured.
	The water of Kobayashi brewery is tap water supplied by the 
town. It is soft water. The hardness is about 30 mg/L (CaCo3, calcium 
carbonate). The brewery used the well water. The hardness of the well 
water was about 50 mg/L. This is another reason that they make light 
tasting rice wine. 
	(See Kuromatsunai Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for hard 
water; See Asahikawa City in Sorachi sub-prefecture for rice wine.)
 	* * *
	When I went to Brazil, I visited a small distillery of pinga. 
(The word ``pinga'' is Portuguese. It means ``drip.'' It signifies 
cachaca [cacha\u00E7a], which is a distilled spirit made from sugar 
cane.)
	The producer used plastic barrels for preserving pinga. He said 
that plastic does not affect the taste. City residents in Sao Paulo 
however insisted that wooden barrels were better. Wooden barrels could 
be displayed at restaurants.

Yuubari [yu-u-ba-ri] [\u5915\u5F35] is a city in Sorachi sub-
prefecture, central Hokkadou (``dou-ou''). It is located in the upper 
reaches of the Yuubari River. It is a city in the Yuubari Mountains. 
Forests occupy 86 percent of the area. #1 
 	The name ``Yuubari'' comes from ``yu-paro'' in Ainu language. 
It means ``hot spring, river mouth.'' Or, it comes from ``i-par'' in 
Ainu language. It means ``it, mouth.'' Both signify the mouth of the 
Yuubari River. In the past, Yuubari River met the Chitose River. Low 
temperature hot spring (kou-sen) flowed into the Yuubari River. #2
 	In 1888 (Meiji 21), a coal strata was discovered along the 
Shihoro-kabetsu River, which is a tributary of the Yuubari River. In 
1892 (Meii 25), Hokkaidou Colliery Co. (Hokutan) started coal mining. 
The Hokkaidou Colliery Railway opened between Yuubari and Oiwake.
 	In the same year, the Hokkaidou Colliery Railway opened 
between Iwamizawa, Oiwake, and Muroran. The company started 
transporting coal from the Yuubari mountains to the Port of Muroran and 
to the Port of Otaru. (See Iwaizawa City in Sorachi sub-prefecture for 
stations on Hokkaidou Colliery Railway.)
	In 1897 (Meiji 30), the administrative office (``kochou-
yakuba'') of Noborikawa [\u767B\u5DDD] village was established. It was 
separated from Yuni village. #3
	In 1906 (Meiji 39), Noborikawa Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was estabised. In 1918 (Taishou 7), the name was changed from Noborkawa 
to Yuubari. In 1919 (Taisou 8), Yuubari Town (1st-class municipality) 
was established. In 1943 (Shouwa 18), Yuubari City was established. 
(See the note of Nanporo Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class 
municipalities.)
	The city hall of Yuubari is located along the Shihoro-kabetsu 
River. It is located in a narrow valley. Yuubari Station near the 
city hall opened between 1892 and 2019. After the opening of the 
Sekishou Line in 1981, it became a terminal for the Yuubari branch of 
the Sekishou Line.
	To the south, the Sekishou Line and National Route 274 
(Hobetsu-kokudou) run. (The owner of the Sekisou Line changed from 
JNR [Japanese National Railways] to JR [Japan Raiway] Hokkaidou in 
1987.) Near Shin-yuubari Station on the Sekishou Line, National Route 
452 (Yuubari-kokudou) branches off from National Route 274. #4
	National Route 452 runs along the Yuubari River. It passes Lake 
Shuuparo (dam lake) in Yuubari City, Katsurazwa Lake (dam lake) in 
Mikasa City, and reaches Ashibetsu City. It does not pass the city 
hall of Yuubari.
  	Yuubari was a city of coal mining. It flourished from the Meiji 
period to the Shouwa period. The population peaked at 107,972 in 1960 
(Shouwa 35) (by Population Census). Today, Yuubari is the third least 
populated city in the country. 
	(The least is Utashinai City [4,390 people in 2010] and the 
second least is Mikasa City [10,255]. Both are coal mining 
municipalities in Sorachi sub-prefecture.) 
	(For coal mining, see Kuriyama Town, Bibai City, Mikasa City, 
Naie Town, Ashibetsu City, Kami-sunagawa Town, Utashinai City, Akabira 
City, and Numata Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture. For coal 
transportation, see Otaru City in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture, Abira 
Town, Muroran City in Iburi sub-prefecture, Iwamizawa City, and 
Sunagawa City in Sorachi sub-prefecture.) #5 #6 #7 #8 #9 #10
 	Distinctive industries in Yuubari are sightseeing and 
agriculture. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = Melons 248 hectares in 2015,
pasture 38, paddy rice 23, yams 8, fodder 7, tomatoes 5, beans 4, 
watermelons 1, and other vegetables 17; dairy cow - (zero) in 2015.
	As for agriculture, arable land stretches in valleys. The 
area is small. Horticulture thrieves. Yuubari Melon is famous. #11 #12
	After the closure of coal mines, Yuubari changed to a tourist 
city. That was a policy of Tetsuji Nakada, who served as mayor from 
1979 to 2003. Tourist attractions were establised such as the Coal 
Museum, Coal Historical Village (Sekitan-no-rekishi-mura), Melon 
Castle, Yuubari Robot Museum, and Mt. Reisui Ski Resort, and Yuubari 
Film Festival.
	Investment in tourism sectors increased, the population 
decreased, and Yuubari City was designated as a municipality for 
financial reconstruction (zasei-saiken-dantai) in 2007. Meron Castle 
was abandoned. The Coal Historical Village and the Yuubari Robot 
Museum were closed. #13 #14

#1  The upstream of the Yuubari River is an incised meander (sen-nyuu-
dakou [\u7A7F\u5165\u86C7\u884C] (by the Geospatial Information 
Authority of Japan [Kokudo-chiri-in]). Built-up areas of Yuubari City 
are located along valleys upstream from the incised meander.
	I visited Yuubari City in late April. There was still a lot of 
snow. In Sapporo, snow melts in early April. Near a built-up areas in 
Yuubari, I saw a large mine-dump mountain (``zuri-yama'' or spoil tip). 
(See Akabira City in Kamikawa sub-prefecture for mine-dump mountain.)

#2  The name ``Yuubari'' meant the downstream area of the Kyuu-yuubari 
River, which means the former Yuubari River. The land is flat. It 
includes Naganuma Town, Kuryama Town, and Yuni Town today.
	Today, the Yuubari River meets the Ishikari River. In the past, 
it met the Chitose River. (See Nanporo Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture 
for the Yuubari River.) In Ainu culture, a river starts from the mouth. 
A river name is a place name. They lived on fish (salmon).

#3  The name ``Nobori-kawa'' is Japanese. It means ``climbing, river.'' 
It is a translation of ``si-horka-pet'' in Ainu language, which means 
``large, U-turn, river.'' The etymology is similar to Horokanai Town 
in Kamikawa sub-prefecture.

#4 The Sekishou Line opened in 1981. It goes through the Hidaka 
Mountains. In the past, railroad detoured the Hidaka Mountains. People 
used the Nemuro Main Line to travel east of the mountain range.
	The former name of Shin-yuubari Station was Momoji-yama 
Station. In the past, the railroad connecting Oiwake, Momoji-yama, and
Yuubari was called the Yuubari Line. The name ``Momiji'' is Japanese. 
It means maple trees. Maples are deciduous trees whose leaves turn 
yellow or red in autumn.
	I passed near the former Momiji-yama Station during an 
excursion. It was late October. The maples in the moutains were very 
beautiful. I said to the micropone, ``The maples in the mountains are 
very beautiful.''
	In the past, the Yuubari Railway of Hokkaidou Colliery also 
run between the stations of Yuubari, Kuriayama, Nanporo, and Ebetsu.
The route of the railroad was what is now Prefectural Route 3. Trains 
used to go through narrow valleys and reached Yuubari. 

#5  The first Population Census in Japan was conducted in 1920 (Taishou 
9). These were the results of Hokkaidou Prefecture; Hakodate Ward 
(144,000 people), Otaru Ward (108,000), Sappro Ward (102,000), 
Asahikawa Ward (61,000), Muroran Ward (56,000), Yuubari Town (51,000), 
and Kusiro Ward (39,000).

#6  In the newsletter of Hokaidou Geographical Society published in 
1954 (http://doi.org/10.14917/hgs1951.1954.95), Kazuo Kameda explained 
the uniqueness of Yuubari City based on the following terms;
	(1) Yuubari is huge, (2) Male ratio is high, (3) Houses use 
coal stoves in summer, (4) 10,000 coal miners work for Hokutan 
(Hokkaidou Colliery & Steamship), (5) Beautiful night view, (6) Busy 
shopping street on payday, (7) Horticulture, and (8) Roadless town 
(people use railways).

#7  Coal mines were called ``yamano-hi (or yamano-akari)'' in Japanese. 
It means ``light of mountain.'' A mining engineer wrote, ``Coal miner's 
apartments (``tan-juu'') were packed on mountain slopes. The night view 
was like a swarm of fireflies.
	My senior coal man told me, `When you get married, take your 
wife to Yuubari at night''' (by Tsuneo Fujita's web-page http://
wp1.fuchu.jp/-fujita3/hokutan1-1.htm [last accessed in January 2017], 
archived in HTTP://2242.MOOO.COM/HOK/YUUBARI.TXT).

#8  There were 24 coal mines in Yuubari City. The following were the 
main six ones;
	(1) Hokutan Yuubari was located to the north of the city 
hall. It was in operation between 1889 and 1977. The former site is now 
the Coal Museum. The name ``Hokuatan'' is a abbreviation of ``Hokkaidou 
Tankou Kisen'' in Japanese. The English name is ``Hokkaidou Colliery 
and Steamship.'' Its old name was ``Hokkaidou Colliery and Railway.
	In 1913 (Taishoiu 2), the main branch of Hokutan moved from 
Iwamizawa to Yuubari. (The head offices were located in Muroran and 
Tokyo.) Hokutan is a Mitsui group company. Mitsui was one of the huge 
conglomerates called ``zaibatsu'' before the war.
	The guest house of Hokutan is preserved in Yuubari. The name 
of the building is ``Hokutan-shikano-tani Club.'' It is located in 
Shikano-tani district near the city hall. (``Shika'' means ``deer'' in 
Japanese. In the Japanese playing cardrs ''hana-fuda,'' maple and deer 
are printed together.)
	In April 1912, an explosion happened underground, killing 267 
miners. In December 1912, an explosion happened underground, killing 
216 miners. In 1920, an explosion happened underground, killing 209 
miners. In 1965, an explosion happened underground, killing 61 miners.
	(The novel ``The Crab Cannery Ship'' depicts the explosion in 
1920. See Otaru City in Shribeshi sub-prefecture for the novel.)
	(2) Hokutan Shin-yuubari was located in Minami-shimizu-sawa 
district near Shin-yuubari Station. It was in operation between 1975 
and 1982.
	In 1981, an explosion happened underground, killing 93 miners. 
I watched the accident on television. Water was poured into the shaft 
to extinguish the fire. It was before the miners bodies were pulled up.
The former site of the shaft is opened (but fenced) so as to the air 
reaches their souls.
	Hokutan Shin-yuubari was the new coal mine that was supported 
by subsidies from the Japanese government. New technologies was 
introduced. High production targets were set.
	(National universities are also supported by subsidies from the 
the government. Three professors in a faculty of a national university 
died in 15 years.)
	(3) Hokutan Heiwa was located in Heiwa district. It was in 
operation between from 1920 and 1930 and between 1937 and 1975.
	(4) Hokutan Mayachi was located in Mayachi district. It was in 
operation between 1905 and 1987. It was the last coal mine of Hokutan 
in Yuubari City. (The last coal mine of Hokutan was in operation in 
Utashinai City until 1995.)
	(5) Mitsubishi Ooyuubari was operated between 1929 and 1973. 
The former site of the coal mine is now under Lake Shuuparo (dam lake). 
Mitsubishi was also one of the huge conglomerates called ``zaibatsu'' 
before the war.
	(6) Mitsubisi Minami-ooyuubari. It was operated between 1970 
and 1990. The former site of the coal mine is now under Lake Shuuparo. 
It was the last underground coal mine in Yuubari City. (The last 
underground coal mine in Sorachi sub-prefecture was located in 
Utashinai City until 1995.)
	In 1985, an explosion happened underground, killing 62 miners. 
As well as Hokutan Shin-yuubari, this coal mine was the new one 
supported by subsidies from the government. (See Utashinai City in 
Sorachi sub-prefecture for taboos among coal miners.)

#9  The coal of Hokkaidou is originated mainly from meta-sequoia 
deposits. Meta-sequoia is a deciduous and coniferous tree. It can be 
seen many streets in the country, including the Tama Hills where I 
live now (Nihei lab 2023b).
	Meta-sequoia trees grew densely in Hokkaidou during Tertiary 
period of Cenozoic era (2.5-65 million years ago). The coal is new. In 
the USA and Europe, coal is mined from older strata, which were created 
in the Carboniferous period of Paleozoic era (300-350 million years 
ago).
	* * *
	Coal is used for industrial purposes. Large factories including
power plants, paper mills, and steel mills, use coal and coke. (Coke is 
made from coal and use in steel mills. Coke furnaces generate high 
temperatures.)
        For domestic purposes, coal stoves were used until the 1970s 
in Sapporo. I lived in an old teacher's apartment, which was built in 
the 1960s. Each room equipped a coal storage. Small pieces of coal were
found in the apartment's garden.
	From the 1970s, kerosene stoves spread. From the 2000s, air 
conditioners spread. Japan is a maritime country. Tankers import oil 
and colliers import coal.

#10  A house in ``The Yellow Handkerchief (1977 film)'' is preserved 
in Yuubari. It is a typical coal miner's house. Coal miner's houses and 
coal miner's apartments were the symbol of ``Ichizan-ikka.'' It means 
``one mountain, one family.'' 

#11  Yuubari Melon has orange pulp. The color was unique. Melons 
generally had green pulp. When I traveled Hokkaidou in the 1990s, I 
stopped at a melon shop along a road.
	The seller, a middle-aged woman, sold two types of melons, 
green and orange. She said, ``Green pulp is sweeter.'' My friend said, 
``Orange is a cross-bred with pumpkin.'' I bought green one. (The 
orange one was not Yuubari Melon.)
	* * *
 	As for Yuubari Melon, farmers started studying how to cultivate 
melons in the 1950s. They managed to get the melon seeds that could be 
used for cross-breeding. Those were original seeds. The farmers 
experimented cross-breeding. The first Yuubari Melon was sold in 1961. 
	(Today, melon seeds and seedlings are sold by companies such as 
Sakata Seed, which sells melon varieties of Andesu and Prince. The name 
``Andesu'' comes from Anshin-desu in Japanese. It means ``relief.'' It 
signifies ``relief for cultivation, relief for selling, and relief for 
eating.'')
	* * *
	Farmers in Yuubari also adopted a unique salling method. They
distribute only catalogues at department stores. Yuubari Melon could 
not be bought at general grocery stores.
 	In 1973, farmers registered the trademark of Yuubari Melon. In 
1979, they registered the design of Yuubari Melon sticker, which is 
put on the melons. In 1993, they registered the name ``Yuubari Melon.'' 
The registration was difficult, because ``Yuubari'' is a common name 
(place name) and ``melon'' is also a common name.
 	In 2006, 154 farmers cultivate melons in Yuubari. The harvest 
amounts 5,000 tons. Sales total 3,000,000,000 yen. The peak of the 
harvest is from late June to early August. Melon farmers cultivate 
nothing after melons in the year. They keep honey bees for polination.
	(In the case of the Kantou region, melon farmers cultivate 
tomatoes after melons. They keep honey bees for melons and bumblebees 
for tomatoes [by Nihei 2002 ``Technological innovations in the 
continuation of greenhouse horticulture in Asahi City.'' http://
www.researchgate.net/publication/270038030].) (See Biratori Town in 
Hidaka sub-prefecture for bees.)
 	The first melons are harvested in May in Yuubari. Those were 
sown in January and cultivated in hothouses. The prices of the first 
auction for two Yuubari Melons were 800,000 yen in 2006, 2,000,000 
yen in 2007, and 1,000,000 yen in 2011. They were the celebration 
prices (go-shuugui-souba). They were also advertising.
	These are the conditions for making Yubari Melon. The soil of 
Yuubari is composed of volcanic ash. Soil temperature rises in summer 
both in upland fields and paddy fields. Drainage is good. (Melons has 
been cultivated in paddy fields after the enactment of the rice 
reduction policy [``guentan-seisaku''].)
	Yuubari is surrounded by mountainous and the temperature 
decreases at night. Melons become sweeter. (At cool nights, crops 
sleep without consuming the sugars they produced during the day.)

#12  Recently, the area of medicinal herbs increased in Yuubari. 
Tsumura is a herbal medicine company that started cultivating medicinal 
herbs in Yuubari. The company also runs a processing factory.
	These are reasons why the company is located in Yuubari (by N. 
Ishida (2018) ``Characteristics of medicinal crop production in 
Hokkaido, Japan'' http://doi.org/10.7886/hgs.93.1).
	(1) Contract farmers of the company cultivate medicinal herbs 
in the Ishikari Plain and the Tokachi Plain. Yuubari is located between 
them.
	(2) Yuubari is near to the Port of Tomakomai. Medicinal herbs 
are shipped from the port.
	(3) The company intends to support Yuubari City, where the 
population decreased drastically.
	* * *
 	Medicinal herbs grow well under a cool climate, for example, 
Sugadaira highland in Nagano Prefecture (by T. Uezu et al. (2007) 
``Characteristic of vegetable production in a high altitude and cool-
climate region.'' http://www.researchgate.net/publication/387948304).
	Mt. Ibuki in central Honshuu island was also famous for medical 
herb cultivation (by T. Nihei 2018 ``The regional geography of Japan.'' 
ISBN 9784832903739).

#13  I visited the Coal Museum in late April 2012. It was during a new-
comer's camp for Regional Science Course, Faculty of Letters. The 
museum was built on an old coal mine. I remembered the scene of 
Yuubari's mining disaster in 1981. I watched it on the TV when I was in 
elementary school.
	The Coal Museum has exhibitions in old tunnels. There is a 
miner's family living room. A supper table is in it. Dolls of miners 
are displayed. Dolles of a rescue team is displayed. It is a very 
impressive museum. 

#14  I visited Melon Castle in late September 1998. It was during an 
excursion organized by the Association of Japanese Geographers. Melon 
Castle distilled melon brandy. This is the slide I took at the time.
  --> HTTP://2242.MOOO.COM/POSI/98HOK/6025.JPG
	I was a graduate student at the time. The excursion became the 
model for my excursions. The chief organizer was Professor Katsuhiko 
Yamashita. The report is available here; http://doi.org/10.4157/
grj1984a.72.1_43 (pages 12-14).
	These are other slides I took during the excursion;

	After getting a job at Hokkaidou University, I had 
opportunities to attend excursions with Katsuhiko Yamashita. Those were 
very good experiences.

Tsukigata [tsu-ki-ga-ta] [\u6708\u5F62] is a town in Sorachi sub-
prefecture, central Hokkaidou (Dou-nan). The area is located on the 
west bank of the Ishikari River.
	The name ``Tsukigata'' comes from Kiyoshi Tsukigata, who was 
the first warden of Kabato Prison (Kabato-shuuchi-kan). He was the 
former samurai from the Fukuoka Domain.
	The name ``Kabato'' comes from ``kapato'' in Ainu language. It 
means ``yellow pond lily (`kouhone' in Japanese).'' Ainu people ate 
the roots of yellow pond lily.
 	In 1881 (Meiji 14), Kabato Prison was established. The 
administrative office (``kochou-yakuba'') of Tsukigata was established. 
In 1882 (Meiji 15), the county hall (``gun-yakusho'') of Kabato was 
established. It covered Uryuu county and Kamikawa county. #1 #2
 	They were the first administrative office and the first county 
hall in the middle and upper reaches of the Ishikari River. (Today, 
Uryuu county is located in the north of the Ishikari Plain. Kamikawa 
county is located in the Kamikawa Basin, which includes Asahikawa 
City). 
 	In 1906 (Meiji 39), Tsukigata Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established. In 1953 (Shouwa 28), Tsukigata Town was established. 
(See the note of Nanporo Town for 2nd-class municipality.) 
	The town hall of Tsukigata is located near the Subetsu [\u9808
\u90E8\u90FD] River. National Route 275 and Sasshou line pass. 
Tsukigata Hot Spring is located near the town hall. #3
 	Distinctive industries in Tsukigata are agriculture and 
sightseeing. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 1,129 hectares in 
2015, wheat 334, beans (soybeans 292, adzuki beans 4), pasture 229, 
	(continued) --> flowers 22 (greenhouse), melons 18, buckwheat 
17, watermelons 14, tomatoes 10, potatoes 9, fodder 6, radishes 4, and 
other vegetables 55+X (pumpkins); dairy cows X (concealed) in 2015.
	Floriculture increased after the enactment of the rice 
reduction policy (``guentan-seisaku'') in the 1970s. Tsukigata became 
one of the largest flower producing municipalties in Hokkaidou.
	Floriculture thrives. The area of floriculture in 2005 counted 
72 hectares (open-field and hothouse), marking the largest in 
Hokkaidou. The main flowers are lilies, carnations, lisianthus 
(``Toruko-kikyou [Turky-kikyou]'' in Japanese), calla lilies, and 
delphinums. (In 2015, the area of floriculture is concealed.) 
	As for sightseeing, the old building of Kabato Prison is a 
tourist attraction. It opened as the Hokkaidou Prison Museum 
(Hokkaidou-gyoukei-shiryou-kan) in 1973. It became the Tsukigata-kabato 
Museum in 1996. It has been designated as Hokkaidou Heritage since 
2018.
	 The novel ``Akai-hito (red people)'' was written by Akira 
Yoshimura in 1977. It was based on real prisoners in Hokkaidou in the 
Meiji period, such as Inazuma-kozou (lightning boy). In connection with 
Hokkaidou University, Shinpachi Nagakura instructed swordmanship to the 
guarts of the Kabato Prison. #4 #5

#1  Kabato Prison was the first prison in Hokkaidou. It was a national 
prison in the Meiji period. The place Kabato was selected because of 
its good access by boat on the Ishikari River.
	There were other two potential places to built the national 
prison. One was Tokachi, however, it was a very remote place at the 
time. The other was around the foot of Mt. Youtei, however, it had 
already many houses. One of the purposes for making the prison in 
Hokkaidou was development.
	Another purpose for making the prison in Hokkaidou was to 
incarcerate political criminals. There were civil wars in the Meiji 
period; the Boshin War, Hagui Rebellion, Saga Rebellion, and the 
Satsuma War (Seinan-sensou). Defeated soldiers were political 
criminals.
	Four prisons were built in Hokkaidou in the Meiji period; (1) 
Kabato Prison (Kabato-shuuchi-kan), established in 1881 (Meiji 14), 
located in what is now Tsukigata Town, Sorachi sub-prefecture. 
	(continued) --> (2) Sorachi Prison (Sorachi-shuuchi-kan), 
established in 1882 (Meiji 15), located in what is now Mikasa City, 
Sorachi sub-prefecture. (3) Kushiro Prison (Kushiro-shuuchi-kan), 
established in 1885 (Meiji 18), located in what is now Shibecha Town, 
Kushiro sub-prefecture.
	(continued) --> (4) Abashiri branch of Kushiro Prison, 
established in 1890 (Meiji 23), located in what is now Abashiri City,
Okhotsk sub-prefecture. Prisoners cleared the wilderness and 
constructed roads.
	In 1919 (Taishou 8), Kabato Prison was moved to Asahikawa 
Ward (now Asahikawa City). Today, prisons are located in Sapporo City, 
Asahikawa City, Obihiro City, Kushiro City (Kushiro branch of Obihiro 
Prison), Abashiri City, Tsukigata Town, and Hakodate City (juvenile 
prison).
	The current Tsukigata Prison was established in 1983. Before 
the establishment, the Japanese government was searching for a site for 
a new prison to replace Nakano Prison in Tokyo. Tsukigata Town invited 
the new prison and was selected, because the town had a history of 
a penal system.
	(In Nakano Prison, Tokyo, the novelist Takiji Kitaji was 
incarcerated before the war. He wrote ``The Crab Cannery Ship.'' See 
Otaru City in Shiribesi sub-prefecture for the novelist.)
	I heard that the food of Tsukigata Prison is good. (In 
Hokkaidou, food is good.) Prisoners in Tsukigata produce tables and 
chairs, which called ``ashi-mono (things with legs).''
	The products were sold at a on-line shipping site of CAPIC 
(Correctional Association Prison Industry Cooperation). How about 
buying a wooden chair for your office?

#2  Prisoner roads (prisoner-built roads) in Hokkaidou were called 
``Shuujin-douro'' in Japanese. Prisoners constructed roads in the Meiji 
Meiji period. The first one opened between Kabato Prison and Sorachi 
Prison. (Kabato Prison was located in what is now Tsukigata Town and 
Sorachi Prison was located in what is now Mikasa City.)
	The first prisoner road was constructed between 1886 and 1890. 
The road traversed the Ishikari Plain, crossing the Ishikari River by 
boat. It is now called Kabato Road (Kabato-douro, part of Prefectural 
Route 275), which connects Tsukugata Town, Bibai City, and Mikasa City. 
The road crosses Tsukigata-oohashi Bridge over the Ishikari River,  
passes near Miyajima Pond. 
	The road is almost straight, although it bends slightly. The 
shape like the Japanese word ``he.'' The road detoured large ponds 
at the time. http://cyberjapandata.gsi.go.jp/#12/43.301196/141.753502/
	Logs were laid on the road in the Meiji period. They allow 
horse-drawn carriages to pass the Ishikari Plain. The logs were made 
from Japanese elm (Haru-nire or Akadamo). The trees were rampant in the 
plain in the Meiji period. Today, the straight road passes through 
extensive paddy fields. (See Yuni Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for 
straight roads).
	These are major prisoner roads;
	(1) Kabato Road (see above); built by the prisoners of Kabato 
Prison and Soracih Prison; It can be seen clearly from Mt. Tappu in 
Mikasa City.
	(2) Kamikawa Road (Kamikawa-douro); built between 1887 and 
1889, by the prisoners of Kabato Prison and Sorachi Prison; connecting 
Ichikisiri (now Mikasa City) and Chuubetsu-but (now Asahikawa City); 
It is now part of National Route 12.
	(3) Teshio Road (Teshio-douro); built between 1887 and 1892, 
mainly by the prisoners of Kabato Prison; connecting Kabato Prison (now 
Tsukigata Town) in the Ishikari Plain and Mashike on the Sea of Japan 
side; It is now part of National Route 275 and part of Prefectural 
Route 94. (http://cyberjapandata.gsi.go.jp/#12/43.743817/141.688614/) 
	(4) Yuubari Road; built between 1889 and 1890, mainly by 
the prisoners of Sorachi Prison; connecting Iwamizawa, Kakuta (now 
Kuriyama Town), and Yuubari; It is an old road along the foot of the 
Yuubari Mountains. (See Kuriyama Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture.)
 	(5) Central Road (Chuuou-douro); built in 1891, mainly by the 
prisoners of Abashiri branch of Kushiro Prison; connecting Asahikawa 
and Abashiri; It is now part of National Route 39.
	Prisoner roads accompanied sacrifice. The dead were buried 
along the roads. The burial mounds are called Chain-mounds (kusari-
zuka). Chain shackles were tombs.
	Professor Chiaki Oguchi at University of Tsukuba described the 
situation as ``gradual death sentence (kanman-na-shikei).'' (For 
prisons and prisoner roads, see Kuriyama Town, Mikasa City in Sorachi 
sub-prefecture, Obihiro City in Tokachi sub-prefecture, Kitami City, 
Abashiri City in Okhotsk sub-prefecture, Shibecha Town, Teshikaga Town, 
and Shiranuka Town in Kushiro sub-prefecture.)

#3  ``Subetsu'' is an old place name. It comes from ``si-pet'' in Ainu 
language. It means ``large, river.'' The meaning is the same as 
Shibetsu City in Kamikawa sub-prefecture and Shibetsu Town in Nemuro 
sub-prefecture.
	The pronunciation ``shi-betsu (subetsu, or si-pet)'' in 
Japanese sounds like ``death, separate.'' The first Japanese immigrants 
used Kabato instead of Subetsu.
	Today, Kabato-sakai River flows on the border between Urausu 
Town and Shin-totsukawa Town, and the Kabato River flows in Shin-
totsukawa Town. Both are located north of Tsukigata Town.

#4   As for the novel ``Akai-hito (Red People),'' prisoners in 
Hokkaidou during the Meiji period wore red clothes. If prisoners 
escape, they could be found soon by the color.
	The novel is fiction but written based on real prisoners. These 
were unique prisoners; 
	(1) Keijirou Sakamoto; a burglar, murderer, rapist, and prison 
escapee. He was incarcerated in Kabato and other prisons. He escaped 
from Kabato Prison. He run away 48-ri (188 kilometers) per day. His 
nickname was lightning boy (Inazuma-kozou).
	(2) Torakichi Nishikawa; an attempted murderer, arson, and 
prison escapee. He was incarcerated in Kabato, Abashiri, Akita, and 
other prisons. He escaped from Akita Prison in Honshuu island. At the 
time, he stepped on a board with 15-centimeters' nails (to prevent 
prisoners from escaping).
	His nickname was Gosunkugi-no-torakichi (Torakichi of 15 
centimeters' nail]). He was also called as the king of prison breaks 
(datsugoku-ou). (See Hidaka Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture for a story 
of 15-centimeters' nail.)
	(3) Chouan Kumasaka; a counterfeiter (counterfeit banknote 
maker). He was an mysterious person. He was a painter, a medical 
doctor, and a teacher. He might have been falsely accused. He dead in 
Tsukigata Prison. His life was also depicted in the novel ``Fuun-na-
namae (unfortunate name)'' written by Seichou Matsumoto.
	(As for counterfeiter, the cartoon ``Lupin the Third'' depicts 
one. Lupin said `Your work is better than the real one' and the 
counterfeiter was disappointed. See Hamanaka Town in Kushiro sub-
prefecture for Lupin the Third.)
 
#5  Shinpachi Nagakura was the strongest swordsman in Shinsen-gumi.  
(Shinsen-gumi was the special forces of the Tokugawa Shogunage.) His 
special sword movement was ``Ryuuhi-ken (flying dragon sword).'' The 
sword moved from bottom to top.
	Shinpachi Nagakura fled the Matsumae Domain (now Matsumae Town 
in Oshima sub-prefecture). After the Meiji period, he lived in Otaru
and instructed swordsman ship in Kabato Prison and in Agriculture 
Collage of Touhoku Imperial University (now Hokkaidou University).
	There is a small monument near the main gate of Hokkaidou 
University, which read ``the place associated with Shinpachi 
Nagakura.'' (See Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the 
swordsman.)

Bibai [bi-ba-i] [\u7F8E\u5504] is a city in Sorachi sub-prefecture, 
central Hokkaidou (``dou-ou''). It extends from the east bank of the 
Ishikari River to the Yuubari Mountains. The area is a basin of the 
Bibai River, which flows from Mt. Bibai (987 meters). The western part 
is mountainous. The eastern part is rice paddies.
 	The name ``Bibai'' comes from ``pipa-o-i'' in Ainu language. It 
means ``mussel, many, place.'' It signified ponds with many mussels. 
The ponds existed in the downstream of the Bibai River.
	In 1890 (Meiji 23), Kainuma [\u6CBC\u8C9D] village was 
established. It was in the administrative office (``kochou-yakuba'') of 
Ichikisiri (now Mikasa City). The name ``Kai-numa'' means ``shellfish, 
pond.'' In 1891 (Meiji 24), Bibai Station on the Hokkaidou Colliery 
Railway (now the Hakodate Main Line) opened.
 	In 1891 and 1894 (Meij 24 and 27), the military settlers' 
colony, Bibai-heison, was established, and 160 families immigrated. In 
1895 (Meiji 28), the administrative office of Kainuma village was 
established. In 1906 (Meiji 39), Kainuma Village (2nd-class 
municipality) was established. (See the note of Nanporo Town for 1st-
class and 2nd-class municipalities.)
 	In 1909 (Meiji 42), Kainuma Village (1st-class municipality) 
was established. In 1925 (Taishou 14), Kainuma Town was established. In 
1926 (Taishou 15), the name changed from Kainuma to Bibai. In 1950 
(Shouwa 25), Bibai City was established.
	The city hall of Bibai is located where the Bibai River enters 
the Ishikari Plain. National Route 12 (chuuou-kokudou) and the 
Hakodate Main Line pass. There is a sign board on National Route 12 
that reads, ``The longest straight road in Japan, 29.2 kilometers.'' 
(See Yuni Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for straight roads.)
	There were two large coal mines in the Yuubari Mountans. They 
were Mitsubishi Bibai Coal Mine and Hokuryou-garo Coal Mine (a 
Mitsubishi group company). The Bibai Line was operated by Mitsubishi 
and transported coal.
	To the south of the city, there was another large coal mine. 
It was Mitsui Bibai Coal Mine located on the foot of the Yuubari 
Mountains. (Mitsui and Mitsubishi were the former ``zaibatsu [huge 
conglomerate]''.) 
	The population of Bibai peaked in 1954 at 91,431 (by Bibai 
City). All of them were underground coal mines and closed in the 
1970s. (See Yuubari City in Sorachi sub-prefecture for coal mining.)
	Distinctive industries in Bibai are manufacturing, agriculture, 
coal mining, and sightseeing. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 
4,351 hectares in 2015, wheat 2,302, beans (soybeans 1,174, adzuki 
beans 8, other beans 7), buckwheat 180, onions 49, pasture 28, orchards 
10 (other fruits 8+X), flowers 7 (greenhouse), fodder 3, tomatoes 3, 
	(continued) --> strawberries 3, melons 3, potatoes 2, radishes 
2, carrots 2, spinach 2, green onions 2, cucumbers 2, lettuce 1, other 
vegetables 75+X (asparagus), and other grains 42; dairy  cows - (zero) 
head in 2015.
 	The area of paddy fields is large. Rice, wheat and soybeans are 
cultivated in paddy fields. Wheat and soybeans increased after the 
enactment of the rice reduction policy (``guentan-seisaku''). The local 
specialty is Hasukappu berries, which are processed into jams and 
cakes. (See Atsuma Town in Iburi sub-prefecture for Hasukappu berry.)
	As for coal mine, although underground coal mines were closed, 
an open-pit coal mine continues. As for manufacturing, there are two 
industrial parks. Factories of plastics, metals, semiconductors, and 
food are in operation. #1 #2
	 As for sightseeing, Arte-Piazza is a museum of sculptor Kan 
Yasuda. The museum opened in 1992, using an old abandoned wooden school 
building. It was an elementary school for the children of coal miners. 
Miyajima Pond on the Ishikari Plain is a stopover point for white-
fronted geese. It is a Ramsar Convention registered area. #3 #4

#1  Many coal mines were printed on old maps. They were symbolized by 
crossed mattocks. When I studied geography at junior high school, there 
were many coal mines on the atlas. (The atlas [chizu-cyou] is a 
textbook inspected by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, 
Science and Technology [MEXT].)
	Coal mines have disappeared from Japanese maps for a long time. 
I moved to Hokkaidou, attended an excursion to Bibai, and found that 
open-pit coal mines still exist. The coal is used in nearby thermal 
power plants. (See Sunagawa City in Sorachi sub-prefecture.)
 
#2  Food factories in Bibai produce unique souvenirs, including non-
melt soft cream, fried noodle bags (fukuro-iri yakisoba), Bekanbe-
monaka (Bekanbe sweet paste of adzuki beans), and Egg of Magan (white-
fronted goose).
 	As for the name ``Bekanbe,'' it comes from ``pe-ka-un-pe'' in 
Ainu language. It means ``water, above, exist, thing.'' It means water 
caltrops (hishi). In old rivers (furu-kawa), water caltrops float. (See 
Ishikari City in Ishikari sub-prefecture for water caltrop.)
	The souvenir ``Egg of Magan'' is a Western-style confectionery 
whose shape is like a goose egg. (Egg of Kamome [seagull] is a souvenir 
from Iwate Prefecture.) Rice flour is also produced in Bibai. It is 
for those with wheat flour allergies.
	``Yakitori (grilled chicken on a skewer)'' is also a local 
specialty. The old-fashioned Motsu-kushi (offal skewer) is famous. It 
incluedes chicken liver, inner egg (kinkan), chicken gizard, and 
chicken heart. Those are inexpensive, nutritious, and eaten with a rich 
sweet sauce.
	(Recently, Japanese people eat large chicken skewers with salt. 
In Brazil, although people eat beef much, barbecue restaurants serve 
chicken liver.)
 
#3  Kan Yasuda is a sculptor from Bibai City. He lives in Pietrasanta, 
Italy. It is a marble producing area. He uses the marble. One of his 
sculptures is installed in Sapporo Station. It is like a large white 
bone. It is famous as a meeting place.

#4  There were about 10 ponds near Miyajima Pond. Thoes were reclaimed 
and turned into rice paddies.
	Flocks of white-fronted geese arrive Miyajima Pond from late 
September to early October, and from mid April to late April. Geese eat 
grass seeds, dropped rice ears after harvest (ochibo), and second ears 
of rice after harvest (hiko-bae).

Mikasa [mi-ka-sa] [\u4E09\u7B20] is a city in Sorachi sub-prefecture, 
central Hokkaidou (``dou-ou''). The area extends from the Ishikari 
Plain to the Yuubari Mountains. It is in the upper reaches of the 
Ikushunbetsu River. (The downstream of the Ikushunbetsu is Iwamizawa 
City.)
 	Mt. Tappu (144 meters) rises on the edge of the Ishikari Plain. 
In the Meiji period, the mountain was a landmark of land surveys. #1
  	The name ``Mikasa'' comes from Mt. Mikasa-yama (594 meters). In 
the Meiji period, a prisoner in Sorachi Prison named the mountain 
``Mikasa-yama'' after his home town's mountain. #2
 	In 1879 (Meiji 12), Horonai Coal Mine opened. In 1882 (Meiji 
15), Sorachi Prison was established. The Horonai Line for coal 
transportation was completed. Prisoners worked in the coal mine. (See 
Otaru City in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for the Horonai Line) #3
 	In 1884 (Meiji 17), an administrative office (``kochou-
yakuba'') of Ichikishiri [\u5E02\u6765\u77E5] and another village 
(Horonai [\u5E4C\u5185]) was established. In 1889 (Meiji 22), the 
administrative office of Ichikishiri and other two villages (Horonai 
and Ikushunbetsu [\u5E7E\u6625\u5225]).
	In 1891 (Meiji 24), the administrative office of Ichikishiri 
and four municipalities (Horonai, Ikushunbetsu, Kainuma [now Bibai 
City], and Yuubari county) was established. Yuubari county was 
separated and included in Sapporo and nine counties' administrative 
office (``gun-yakusho'').
	In 1895 (Meiji 28), Kainuma village was separated. In 1906 
(Meiji 39), Mikasa-yama [\u4E09\u7B20\u5C71] Village (2nd-class 
municipality) was established by the merger of Ichikishiri, Horonai, 
and Ikushunbetsu villages. (See the note of Nanporo Town for 1st-class 
and 2nd-class municipalities.)
 	In 1923 (Taishou 12), Mikasa Village (1st-class municipality) 
was established. In 1942 (Shouwa 17), Mikasa Town was established. In 
1957 (Shouwa 32), Mikasa City was established. 
	The city hall of Mikasa is located near the confluence of the 
Horonai River and the Ikushunbetsu River. National Route 12 (Chuuou-
kokudou) runs to the west. In the past, the Horonai Line ran.
	Horonai Coal Mine was the first modern coal mine in the 
country. It was run by Hokutan (Hokkaidou Colliery & Steamship). 
Ponbetsu Coal Mine was run by Sumitomo (one of the large conglomerates, 
zaibatsu, before the war.)
	The population peaked at 62,781 in 1959 (by Mikasa City). It 
was said, ``one mountain, thirty thousand (hitoyama-san-man).'' This 
means that a large coal mine supported 30,000 people. Today, Mikasa is 
the second least populated city in the country.
	Sumitomo's Ponbetsu Coal Mine was closed in 1971. Hokutan's 
Horonai Coal Mine was closed in 1989. (See Yuubari City in Sorachi sub-
prefecture for coal mine.)
 	Distinctive industries in Mikasa are manufacturing, 
agriculture, and sightseeing. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 
227 hectares in 2015, onions 203, wheat 117, pasture 67, fodder 65, 
soybeans 62, orchards 35 (grapes 20), buckwheat 25, cabbage 12, 
	(continued) --> melons 10, watermelons 7, Chinese cabbage 6, 
cucumbers 5, radishes 1, tomatoes 1, and other vegetables 29+X; dairy 
cows X (concealed) head in 2015.
	As for manufacturing, after coal mines closed, Mikasa 
Industrial Park was established. It is located on the edge of the 
Ishikari Plain. There are factories of agricultural machinery, food 
processing, and construction.
	The large shopping center AEON is also located in the 
industrial park. The category of the land use was changed from 
industrial to commercial.
	As for agriculture, Mikasa melons are a local specialty. Also, 
there is a farm operated by AEON. The vineyards at Mt. Tappu are 
cultivated by Yamazaki Winery. #4
  	Famous sightseeing sites are the Mikasa Railroad Memorial 
Museum, the Mikasa City Museum, Mikasa Geopark, and Lake Katsurazawa. 
Around Mikasa Railroad Memorial Hall, coal miner's apartments (``tan-
juu'') spread. They are the site of Hokutan coal mine. #5 #6 #7
 	At the former site of Sumitomo Ponbetsu Coal Mine, a shaft 
tower (tate-kou) remains. It is a unique landscape. On a bus excursion 
of the Hokkaidou Geographical Society in 2010, we could see the shaft 
closely. A city hall official guided in the site. 

#1  There is an observation deck on the top of Mt. Tappu. Vineyards 
are on the slopes. They can be seen from the Hokkaidou Expressway (Dou-
ou-dou) running at the edge of the Ishikari Plain. Mt. Tappu was a 
popular sightseeing spot in the Meiji period. The rest area was 
crowded. People also watched the Ishikari Plain at the time. 

#2  The original Mikasa-yama is located outside the Nara Basin, Nara 
Prefecture. The another name is Wakakusa-yama. It is a thinking-of-
hometown mountain (``bou-kyou-yama'' [\u671B\u90F7\u5C71]).

#3  The first railroad in Japan opened in 1872 (Meiji 5). It connected
the Port of Yokohama and Shinbashi in Tokyo. The second railroad opened 
in 1874 (Meiji 7), connecting the Port of Koube and Oosaka. The third 
railroad was the Horonai Line in Hokkaidou. 
	The Horonai Line between Otaru and Sappro opened in 1880 (Meiji 
13). It extended to Horonai in 1882 (Meiji 15) and started coal 
transportation between Horonai and the Port of Otaru.
	The first three railroads were run by the Meiji government. In 
1889 (Meiji 22), the management of the Horonai Line was transferred to 
the Hokkaidou Colliery Railway (Hokkaidou-tankou-tetsudou; later 
Hokkaido Colliery & Steamship [Hokutan]).
	* * *
        Horace Capron was an American advisor who worked for the 
Hokkaidou Development Commission (Kaitakushi) from 1871 to 1875. He was
invited by Kiyotaka Kuroda, who was the undersecretary (vice minister)
of the Hokkaidou Development Commission. He suggested transporting coal
from Muroran on the Pacific coast.
        Benjamin Smith Lyman was an American geologist and engineer. He
worked for the Hokkaidou Development Commission from 1872 to 1876, and
for the Japanese government from 1876 to 1879. He surveyed geology in
Hokkaidou, discovered coal in Horonai, and suggested the possibility of
coal mining.  
        Benjamin Smith Lyman suggested transporting coal from Otaru on
the Sea of Japan side. The Hokkaidou Development Commission adopted the
Otaru plan because it was inexpensive.
        Joseph Ury Crawford was an American railroad engineer who
worked for the Hokkaidou Development Commission from 1878 to 1881. He
instructed the construction of the Horonai Line. The former Mikasa 
Station is now Crawford Park. (See Otaru City in Shiribeshi sub-
prefecture for the Horonai Line.)

#4  Yamazaki Winery is a family-run winery. They do not produce in 
quantities. Their wines are difficult to buy. The wines are sold at 
a local supermarket (a-coop, agricultural cooperative market). (See 
Ikeda Town in Tokachi sub-prefecture for wine.)

#5  The Mikasa Railroad Memorial Museum is located on the former site 
of Horonai Station. It was the terminal of the Horonai Line, which was 
the third oldest railroad in the country. A steam locomotive is 
preserved in working order.
	The other terminal of the Horonai Line was Temiya Station in 
Otaru City. The former site of Temiya Station is the Otaru Railway 
Museum (now the Otaru Museum).
	The landscape of coal miner's apartments (``tan-juu'') is 
withered. When I saw coal miner's apartments, I wanted to live there 
for about two years. I would have plenty of time for deep reflection in 
the long winter.
	In coal miner's apartment, workers could buy coal cheaply. The 
family lit stoves even in summer.
	 (In Sapporo City, elementary schools hold athletic festivals 
in June. On 3rd June, 2017, an athletic festival held in Sankaku-yama 
elementary school. The temperature was 11 degree Celsius. Teachers 
prepared a heating room for parents who came to see the athletic 
festival.)
	Houses in Hokkaidou are warm. Even in winter, the room is like 
summer. Once people get used to it, they use the heater even in summer.
	(In the case of Chuuou Ward, Sapporo City, ice cream vendors 
come to residential areas in winter. However, old houses in Hokkaidou 
were cold. The bedding covers were frozen with the moisture from noses.
See Chuuou Ward in Sapporo City, Ishikari sub-prefecture.)

#6  A strata of Cretaceous, which was built 65-150 million years ago, 
can be seen in Mikasa. Fossils of ammonites have been excavated. The 
Mikasa City Museum exhibits fossils of ammonites, Ezo-mikasa-ryuu 
(``Taniwhasaurus''), trilobites (imported from Morocco), and mammothes. 
Ezo-mikasa-ryuu has been designated as natural monument.
 	Since the 1970s, students from elementary schools and junior 
high schools in Sapporo have visited the museum on school tours. 
Recently, geo-tours are popular. Geo-tours will be canceled if a bear 
is spotted.
	The Mikasa City is a mecca for young fossil enthusiasts. One of 
the curators of the museum is from Aichi Prefecture. When he was in six 
grade of elementary school, he tried to visit Mikasa from Aichi by 
bicycle. His parents stopped him.

#7  Lake Katsurazawa is located in the eastern end of Mikasa City. The 
lake was printed on the former country sign (gateway sign). The area 
around the lake is the source of ammonite fossiles. Ezo-mikasa-ryuu 
(``Taniwhasaurus'') was excavated there in 1976. The Mikasa City 
Museum opened in 1979.   
	Lake Katsurazawa is an artificial lake. Katsurazawa Dam is one 
of the oldest dams in Hokkaidou. It was constructed between 1947 and 
1957. The area is included in Furano Ashibetsu Natural Park (Natural 
Park of Hokkaidou). Katsurazawa Hot Spring is located on the lakeside.

Urausu [u-ra-u-su] [\u6D66\u81FC] is a town in Sorachi sub-prefecture, 
central Hokkaidou (``dou-ou''). The area is located in the west bank 
(right bank) of the Ishikari River. It is an inland town in the middle 
reaches of the Ishikari River. In the Ishikari Plain, oxbow lakes 
(crescent moon lakes) remain. #1
	The name ``Urausu'' comes from ``uray-us-pet'' in Ainu 
language. It means ``fish trap, many, river.'' It signified the Urausu 
River. Ainu people put fish trap (``yana'') in the river to catch 
salmon. They lived on dried fish during the long winter.
	In 1887 (Meiji 20), prisoners from Kabato Prison made a road 
between Tsukigata to Osokinai [\u6669\u751F\u5185]. (Okisonai is 
located south of Urausu Town). Japanese people immigrated. In 1899 
(Meiji 32), an administrative office (``kochou-yakuba'') of Urausu 
village was established. It was separated from Tsukigata village. #2
  	In 1909 (Meiji 42), Urausu Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established. In 1960 (Shouwa 35), Urausu Town was established. (See the 
note of Nanporo Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.)
	The town hall of Urausu is located near the Urausu River. 
National Route 275 (Sorachi-kokudou) and the Sasshou Line pass.
	Distinctive industry in Urausu is agriculture, including 
viticulture. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 1,610 hectares in 
2015, wheat 315, pasture 273, buckwheat 193, orchard 131 (grapes X

watermelons 1, other vegetables 32+X, and other grains 12; dairy cows X 
head in 2015, and beef cattle X.
	As for viticulture, Tsurunuma vineyard is located on the foot 
of Mt. Urausu (718 meters). The vineyard covers 450 hectares. Although 
the area of the vineyard is concealed in the census, it is the largest 
vineyard in the country. The landscape is like a foreign country.
	 The vineyard is managed by Hokkaidou Wine in Otaru City, 
Shiribeshi sub-prefecture. In the vineyard, there is a wine shop whose 
name is Tsurunuma winery. (The brewery is located in Otaru City.) The 
name ``Tsuru-numa'' means ``crane, pond'' in Japanese. #3
	Other local specialties include Botan-soba (an old variety of 
buckwheat), asparagus, and Akague-washu (Japanese brown beef cattle). 
#4

#1  From the Hokkadou Express Way (Dou-ou-dou), Mt. Pin-ne-shiri (1,100 
meters) stands out. The mountain has a white cap in May. The summit 
of Mt. Pin-ne-shiri is located at the border between Shin-totsukawa 
Town and Toubetsu Town. (The summit is not included in Urausu Town.) 
	The name ``Pin-ne-shir'' means ``man, be, mountain'' in Ainu 
language. (See Shin-totsukawa Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture and 
Kimobetsu Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for Mt. Pin-ne-shiri.)
	Mt. Kumaneshiri [\u9688\u6839\u5C3B] (971 meters) stands on the 
border between Urausu Town, Tsukigata Town, and Toubetsu Town. The name 
``Kuma-ne-sir'' is the Ainu language. It means ``fish-drying-shelf, be, 
mountain.'' It signifies that the flat mountain top looks like a fish 
drying shelf.

#2  In 1893 (Meiji 26), Takechi Ansai built the Protestant Seien 
Church. He resigned from his seat in the House of Representatives 
(shuu-gui-in-gui-in) and devoted himself to the development of 
Hokkaidou.
 	He died of a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 47. At the time, 
he was on board the Saikan Train Ferry. He was returning to his 
hometown in Kouchi Prefecture.
	In 1897 (Meiji 30), Naohiro Sakamoto took over the church and 
the development. He was a nephew of Ryouma Sakamoto from Tosa (now 
Kouchi Prefecture). Ryouma Sakamoto was an activist who soughtto end 
the Tokugawa Shogunate (Nihei 2018).
 
#3  In the past, the main agricultural product in Urausu was paddy 
rice. In the 1970s, paddy fields expanded and people began to eat more 
Western foods. Rice production exceeded demand. The mayor of Urausu 
Town asked the founder of Hokkaidou Wine to make a vineyard. In 1972, 
land clearing started.
	The climate of Urausu is similar to Germany. The engineers of 
Hokkaidou Wine aimed to produce German-style wine. They imported grape 
seedlings from Germany in 1973. The seedling were preserved in 
quarantine for a year. They were planted in 1974. They died by 
withering or being eaten by wild animals.
	In 1977, Hokkaidou Wine employed a Kellermiester (wine-cellar 
master) from Germany. By the Kellermiester's techniques, the vineyard  
expanded on the foot of Mt. Urausu. (See Ikeda Town in Tokachi sub-
prefecture for wine.)
	(As for wine, I visited wineries in Canada. A man in a small 
wine shop said, `Keeping clean glasses is important.'' [T. Kikuchi et 
al. 2016. Development of wineries and its impact on rural 
commodification of Cowichan Valley in Vancouver Island. ``Chiri-
kuukan'' http://www.researchgate.net/publication/342436377])

#4  Next to Tsurunuma vineyard, there is Jinnai Farm 21. It runs 
cottages with vegetable gardens and grazes Japanese brown cattle 
(Akague-washu). The cattle has a higher lean-meat content and less 
fat content compared to Japanese black cattle (Kurogue-wagyuu).
	The brown cattle are grazed mainly in Kyuushuu and Shikoku 
islands. In Hokkaidou, the main brown cattle is Japanese short-horn 
(Nihon-tankaku). (See Hokkaidou University Ranch in Shin-hidaka Town, 
Hidaka sub-prefecture, for Hokkaidou University Ranch.)
	In the past, Jinnai Farm 21 cultivated mangoes in a greenhouse. 
It was the northern limit for mango cultivation in the country. The 
founder was Ryouichi Jinnai. He was also the founder of Promise, which 
is a legal moneylender company (``sara-kin''). He was born on a farm 
in Shikoku island.

Naie [na-i-e] [\u5948\u4E95\u6C5F] is a town in Sorachi sub-prefecture, 
central Hokkaidou (``dou-ou''). The area extends from the east bank 
(left bank) of the Ishikari River to the Yuubari Mountains. It is a 
small inland town.
 	The name ``naie'' comes from ``naey'' in Ainu language. It 
means ``valley river.'' Or, it comes from ``naye'' in Ainu language, 
which means ``the river.''
	1891 (Meiji 24), Naie Station on the Hokkaidou Colliery Railway 
(now the Hakodate Main Line) opened. In 1944 (Shouwa 19), Naie Village 
(1st-class municipality) was established. It was separated from 
Sunagawa Town. In 1950 (Shouwa 25), Naie Town was established. 
(Sunagawa was called Nae from 1890 to 1903; See the note of Nanporo 
Town for 1st-class municipalty.) #2
    	The town hall of Naie and the center of the town are located 
along the Naie River. They were built on the river terrace of the 
Ishikari River. National Route 12 (Chuuou-kokudou) and the Hakodate 
Main Line pass. The national highway is the longest straight road in 
the country. It has 29 kilometers. Naie is at the mid-point.
	The population peaked in 1960 at 18,458 (by Population Census). 
In the past, there were Sumitomo Naie Coal Mine and Mitsui Oku-naie 
Coal Mine. Mitsui Oku-naie was closed in 1967. Sumitomo Naie was closed 
in 1971. (See Yuubari City in Sorachi sub-prefecture for coal mining.) 
#3
 	Distinctive industries in Naie are manufacturing, agriculture, 
and power generation. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 1,233 
hectares in 2015, wheat 180, beans (soybeans 55, adzuki beans 3),

6+X, other grains 17, and melons X; dairy cows 256 head in 2015.
	Local specialties are melons ans lily bulbs. Early melon 
producing areas in Hokkaidou are Yuubari City, Naie Town, Mikasa City, 
and Hobetsu Town (now Mukawa Town). Among them, Yuubari, Naie, and 
Mikasa were coal mining municipalities. Hobetsu is mountainous. (See 
Makkari Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for lily bulbs.) 
	As for manufacturing, Kamaya Electric Co. produces electronic 
components, Hokkaidou Sumiden Seimitsu (Sumitomo Group) produces 
cemented carbide (``choukou-goukin''), and Hokkaidou Denki (Sumitomo 
Group) produces electric wires. The factories were attracted to 
the town's industrial park after coal mines were closed.
 	As for sightseeing, there is Naie Hot Spring. It was built at 
the former site of Mitsui Naie Junior High School (closed in 1971). The 
hot spring is run by Naie Town. I stayed there during a training camp 
for new faculty members at Hokkaidou University. #4 #5
	Near Naie Sunagawa Interchange, the Hokkaidou Expressway passes 
Hokkai-kansen-yousuiro (Hokkai Main Canal). It was constructed between 
1924 and 1929. There was no heavy machinery at the time. The waterway 
meanders along the contour lines. It is a beautiful canal. #6

#1  Nana-kamado is Rowan tree in English. It is also known as mountain-
ash. In the case of Honshuu island, Nana-kamado grows on high 
mountains. I saw the trees on Mt. Neko-dake (2,207 meters) during an 
excursion (by the Department of Tourism Science in 2024). In the case 
of Canada, the trees grow suburban lowlands.
	It the case of Hokkadou island, Nana-kamado grows from zero 
meters above sea level, as well as Canada. The trees are beautiful and 
are that planted along avenues.
	The name ``Nana-kamado'' means ``seven, kitchen stove.'' It 
signifies that the wood is so hard that it can be burned even times 
in a kitchen stove. (I think ash [``aodamo''] is harder than Nana-
kamado.)
	Nana-kamado bears red berries throughout the winter. In late 
February, berries are eaten by birds. (They do not eat them in 
December.) Maybe, the birds are very hungry, or the berries become 
delicious in February.

#2  Around the year when Naie Station opened, Colonial Rectangular 
Land Division (Shokuminchi-kukaku) was completed in Nae wilderness 
(Nae-guen-ya). The name Nae-guen-ya [\u5948\u6C5F\u539F\u91CE] remains 
in Nae Town. Nae wilderness was the second Colonial Rectangular Land 
Division. (See Shin-totsukawa Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for 
Colonial Rectangular Land Division.)

#3  At the mid-point of the longest straight road is Roadside Station 
``Hausu-yarubi.'' The name comes from the sister city Hausjarvi 
[Hausj\u00E4rvi] in Finland.
	In 1994, Naie Town sent a research team to Hausjarvi, including 
assembly members, doctors, and welfare officials. The town intended to 
make a welfare town. After coal mines closed, the population declined. 
	(Japanese people think that the people in north Europe lead  
happy lives. That might be a delusion. The percentage of happiness 
[self-esteem] and the percentage of drag use [antidepressant] is a 
positive correlation. Suicide rates were high in areas with cloudier 
and colder climates.)

#4  The training camp for new faculty members held in Naie was fun. At 
night, a party continued endlessly. A professor at the dental school 
said, ``during a campus festival, teachers pay 10,000 yen for a pack of
``takoyaki'' (octopus dumpling), which students bring to their 
offices.''
	 Takoyaki and ``yakisoba'' (sauce noodle) are sold at campus 
festivals. An associate professor at the faculty of letters (me) eats 
150-yen instant yakisoba for lunch. Yakisoba-bentou of Seicomart 
(convenience stores in Hokkaidou) comes with powder for making soup.
The hot water to make yakisoba can be reused.
 
#5  As for power generation, Naie Power Station of Hokkaidou Electric 
Power is located along the Ishikari River. It has chimneys with red 
and white stripes. From the Hokkaidou Expressway (Dou-ou-dou), 
chimneys of Sunagawa Power Station even more stand out. (See Sunagawa 
City in Sorachi sub-prefecture.)

#6  The length of the Hokkai Main Canal is 80 kilometers. The headwater 
(``toushu-kou'' [\u982D\u9996\u5DE5] in Japanese) is located at the 
Sorachi River in Akabira City. The canal ends in Nanporo Town. It was 
constructed before World War II. (Currently, the longest irrigation 
canal is the Toyogawa Canal in Aichi Prefecture, whose length is 98 
kilometers.)
	The elevation difference of the Hokkai Main Canal is 28 meters. 
Siphones and aqueducts are used. The headwater was constructed by a 
young engineer, Eiji Hiraga. (He lead the project.)
	He transported stones in winter. He utilized the frozen Sorachi 
River, hired horse-drawn sleighs, transported stones for construction, 
and started construction in spring. The stones were the ``kenchi-ishi 
[\u9593\u77E5\u77F3] (cubic stone)'' that were extracted and processed 
in Noboribetsu, Iburi sub-prefecture.
	His teacher was Eizaburou Ueno, a professor at Tokyo Imperial 
University (now the University of Tokyo), who was the owner of the 
loyal dog Hachikou. The dog is famous for its statue in front of 
Shibuya Station in Tokyo.
	(The dog was Akita-ken [Akita dog]. The origin of Akita-ken is 
the dogs bred by hunters in Akita Prefecture. Akia-ken is larger than 
people imagine today.)
	As for irrigation, water is supplied from rivers in snowy 
regions. Water is supplied from reservoirs in warm regions. As for 
sleigh, horse-drawn sleigh transported lumbers in winter in Hokkaidou.  
In summer, carriages were damaged from bad roads.
	The technique of making carriage was imported from the USA. The 
technique for making sleigh was imported from Russia (by Asahikawa City 
(2006) ``Shin-Asahikawa-shi-shi [New Asahikawa History]''). (See Assabu 
Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for sleigh.)

Ashibetsu [a-shi-be-tsu] [\u82A6\u5225] is a city in Sorachi sub-
prefecture, central Hokkaidou (``dou-ou''). It is an inland city. The 
area is located in the Yuubari Mountains. The Sorachi River, a 
tributary of the Ishikari River, flows. The forest area is extensive. 
National forests (kokuyuu-rin) cover most of it.
	The name ``Ashibetsu'' comes from ``as-pet'' in Ainu language. 
It means ``steep (stand), river.'' It signified the Ashibetsu River, 
which is a tributary of the Sorachi River.
	In 1894 (Meiji 27), two immigrant groups settled in Panke-
horonai. They came from Ishikawa Prefecture and Toyama Prefecture. In 
1900 (Meiji 33), the administrative office (``kochou-yakuba'') of 
Ashibetsu village was established. It was separated from Utashinai 
village (now Utashinai City).
	In 1913 (Taishou 2), Shimo-ashibetsu Station opened on the 
Kushiro Main Line (now the Nemuro Main Line). In 1923 (Taishou 12), 
Ashibetsu Village (1st-class municipality) was established. In 1941 
(Shouwa 16), Ashibetsu Town was established. In 1953 (Shouwa 28), 
Ashibetsu City was established. (See the note of Nanporo Town for 1st-
class municipality).
	The city hall of Ashibetsu is located near the confluence of 
the Ashibetsu River and the Sorachi River. National Route 38 
(Ashibetsu-kokudou) and the Nemuro Line pass. National Route 452 
(Yuubari-kokudou) branches off from National Route 38.
	Coal mines thrived in the past. Five companies ran coal mines, 
including the huge conglomerates (zaibatu) Mitsui and Mitsubishii. They 
were called the ``Ashibetsu Five Mountains (Ashibetsu-gozan).'' The 
population peaked at 75,309 in 1958 (by Ashibetsu City). (See Yuubari 
City in Sorachi sub-prefecture for coal mining.) #1 #2
 	Distinctive industries in Ashibetsu are manufacturing 
(machinery, electrical equipment, wood, lumber, food), agriculture, and 
sightseeing. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 1,552 hectares in 
2015, buckwheat 390, pasture 365, fodder 96, wheat 95, orchards 12, 
	(continued) --> flowers 9, beans 7, tomatoes 1, other 
vegetables 66+X (pumpkins), other grains 15; dairy cows 351 head in 
2015.
	After coal mines (``tankou'') decreased, sightseeing 
(``kankou'') increased. Ashibetsu Leisure Land opened in 1970, where 
the Hokkai-dai-kan-non (large Buddha statue) stands out.
	 Canadian World opened in 1990, which is a theme park of Anne 
of Green Gables. Auto-camping area was developed along Lake Takisato, 
which is a dam lake along National Route 38. #3 #4 #5

#1  Coal mines flourished in Ashibetsu between the 1930s and the 1960s. 
After Wold War II, returners (``hikiagesha'') from Sakalin worked too. 
These were the Ashibetsu Five Mountains;
	(1) Meiji-kougyou Ashibetsu Coal Mine, closed in 1963. (2) 
Mitsubishi-kougyou Ashibetsu Coal Mine, closed in 1964. (3) Ashibetsu-
takane Coal Mine, closed in 1967. (4) Yuya-kougyou Ashibetsu Coal Mine, 
closed in 1969. (5) Mitsui Ashibetsu Coal Mine, closed in 1992. 
	Open-pit mining still continues in Takane district. The coal is 
used in thermal power plants. (See Naie Town and Sunagawa City in 
Sorachi sub-prefecture.)
	Coal miners are the typical working class (proletarians) in 
Marxist philosophy. (University professors in Japan proud of 
themselves, however, they are nothing but working class. They study for 
money [budget]. The middle class people can fly business class without 
any conditions. [Professors cannot].)
 
#2  After the closure of coal mines, 16 elementary schools, 10 junior 
high schools, and 4 high schools were closed. The site of Ashibetsu 
City Rai-jyou [\u983C\u57CE] Elementary School changed to Ashibetsu 
Campus of Seisa University. The brick school building has been 
designated as National Tangible Cultural Property [Yuukei-bunka-zai].
 	In the spring of 2008, one student entered Hokkaidou University 
from Hokkadou Ashibetsu High School. The news is documented on the 
high school's Wikipedia (last accessed in January 2018).
	On a bus excursion, I passed in front of Hokkadou Shizunai 
High School in Shin-hidaka Town, Hidaka sub-prefecture. I saw a banner 
on the school building, which read, ``Congratulations! Hokkaidou 
University, One (student)''
	Many parents moved from rural areas to cities for education. 
Many high school students live in dormitories in cities for education. 
(See Otaru City [West in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for high school 
students.)
 
#3  Ashibetsu Leisure Land was an amusement park. The landmarks are 
Hokkai-dai-kan-non (Buddha statue) and a five-story pagoda. The statue 
is 88 meters high and the pagoda is 56 meters high. The pagoda was used 
as a hotel. The amusement park changed to a religious facility. It is 
run by a new Buddhist religion.
 	The following are large Buddha statues in the country; (1) 
Ushiku-daibutsu in Ibaraki Prefectrue, 120 meters, opened in 1992. (2) 
Sendai-dai-kan-non in Miyagui Prefecture, 100 meters, opened in 1991. 
(3) Sekai-heiwa-dai-kan-non in Hyougo Prefecture, 100 meters, opened 
from 1977 to 2006.
	(continued) --> (4) Hokkai-dai-kan-non in Hokkaidou Prefecture, 
88 meters, opened in 1989. (5) Kaga-dai-kan-non in Ishikawa Prefecture, 
73 meters, opened in 1987. (6) Guze-jibo-dai-kan-non in Fukuoka 
Prefecture, 62 meters, opened in 1983. (7) Aizu-jibo-dai-kan-non in 
Fukushima Prefecture, 57 meters, opened in 1987.
	These are historical large Buddha statues; (1) Nara-no-daibutsu 
in Nara Prefecture, 15 meters, opened in 752. (2) Kamakura-no-daibustu 
in Kanagawa Prefecture, 11 meters, opened in 1252. (See Hokkaidou 
University in Kita Ward, Sappro City, Ishikari sub-prefecture, for new 
religions.)
 
#4  Takisato Dam was constructed between 1979 and 1999. The purposes 
are flood control, general water supply, agricultural irrigation, tap 
water supply, and power generation (Hokkaidou Electric Power Company, 
57MW).
	Due to the dam construction, 136 families in Takisato district 
were relocated. Takisato elementary school, Takisato junior high 
school, and Takisato Station on the Nemuro Main Line were abolished. 
People could move. Place names could not be moved.
	Takisato Dam was constructed on the Sorachi River. Floods 
frequently occurred along the river. The Ishikari River is the main 
stream of the Sorachi River. A significant flood damage occurred along 
the Ishikari River in 1981.
	There is Sorachi-oo-taki (Sorachi Great Waterfall) in the 
downstream of Lake Takisato. It is the origin of the place name 
``Sorachi,'' which means ``waterfall, complex falling, river'' in Ainu 
language. (See Sorachi sub-prefecture.)
 
#5  A company from Toukyuu Group opened the theme park ``Canadian 
World'' in Ashibetsu City in 1990. The wife of the company's executive 
was a fan of Anne of Green Gables (a novel; ``Akague-no-Anne'' in 
Japanese).
	Ashibetsu City and Charlottetown in Canada, where the original
Green Gables is located, became sister cities in 1993. (The Green 
Gables is a house where Anne Shirley, the heroine of the novel, lived.)
	Canadian World closed in 1997. It re-opened as a municipal 
park in 1999. The main attraction of the park is the replica of Green 
Gables. When the original Green Gables in Canada was burnt down, it was 
rebuilt based on the blueprints of the replica in Ashibetsu City.
	When I visited Canada, professor Thomas Waldechuck said, ``I 
visited Canadian World in Hokkaidou. It looked fake. The staff did not 
speak English.''
	I visited Canadian World in July 2014. I remembered the Tom's 
words, however, the replica of the Green Gables was great. I could 
imagine the life of Canadians at the time. The rooms had no built-in 
closets (``oshi-ire''). It used to be simple. (Japanese mansions 
[apartments] always advertise the presence of built-in closets.) 
	The air is cool and dry in early summer in Ashibetsu. It is 
similar to Canada. (See Otaru City in Shirbeshi sub-prefecture for the 
theme park of heaven; See Obihiro City in Tokachi sub-prefecture for 
the theme park of old Germany.)

SHIN-TOTSUAWA-STORY'S PLACE. #1 
  
Shin-totsukawa [shi-n-to-tsu-ka-wa] [\u65B0\u5341\u6D25\u5DDD] is a 
town in Sorachi sub-prefecture, central Hokkaidou (``dou-ou''). The 
area extends from the west bank (right bank) of the Ishikari River to 
the Mashike Mountains. Mt. Pin-ne-shiri (1,100 meters) stands out from 
The Ishikari Plain. #2
  	The name ``Shin-totsukawa'' is Japanese. It means ``New 
Totsukawa.'' The original Totsukawa Village is located in Nara 
Prefecture. (The name ``Totsukawa'' comes from the Totsukawa Rver 
flowing in Nara Prefecture.)
	In 1889 (Meiji 22), Colonial Rectangular Land Division 
(Shokuminchi-kukaku [\u6B96\u6C11\u5730\u533A\u753B]) was set in Tokku 
wilderness (Tokku-guen-ya [\u30C8\u30C3\u30AF\u539F\u91CE]). In the 
same year, a major flood disaster occurred along the Totsukawa River 
in Nara Prefecture.
	In 1890 (Meiji 23), 600 families, 2,489 people, who affected by 
the flood disaster, moved to Tokku wilderness. In the same year, the 
administrative office (``kochou-yakuba'') of Shin-totsukawa village 
was established. #3 #4 #5 #6 
	For the next ten years, there were no immigrants from other 
prefectures. It is a unique immigration history in Hokkaidou. In 1902 
(Meiji 35), Shin-totsukawa Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established. In 1957 (Shouwa 32), Shin-totsukawa Town was established. 
(See the note of Nanporo Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class 
municipalities.)
	The town hall of Shin-totsukawa is located near the confluence 
of the Toppu River and the Ishikari River. National Route 275 (Sorachi-
kokudou) runs north on the west bank of the Ishikari River. #7
	National Route 451 (Shokan-kokudou) branches off from National 
Route 275, passes the Mashike Mountains, and reaches the former 
Hamamasu Village (now Ishikari City).
 	Shin-totsukawa Station is the terminal of the Sasshou Line. The 
name ``Sasshou'' comes from ``Satsu-shou,'' which signifies Sapporo and 
Numata. The railroad connected Sapporo City in Ishikari sub-prefecture 
and Numata Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture until 1972. #8
 	Distinctive industries in Shin-totsukawa are paddy rice 
cultivation and sightseeing. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 
3,540 hectares in 2015, buckwheat 363, beans (soybeans 135, adzuki 
beans 4), wheat 135, pasture 84, onions 38, green onions 8, fodder 7, 
	(continued) --> tomatoes 5, melons 5, broccoli 4, orchards 1, 
and other vegetables 36+X; dairy cows X (concealed) head in 2015.
	In the past, rice paddies stretched upstream to valleys, 
including the Socchi-gawa [\u7DCF\u5BCC\u5730\u5DDD] River. Rice 
production exceeded the consumption, the rice reduction policy 
(``guentan-seisaku'') was enacted, and rice paddies in valleys shrunk. 
The land immigrants cleared returned forests.
 	As for sightseeing, the Pioneer Museum (Kaitaku-kinen-kan) 
is located near the town hall. Next to the museum is Izumo-taisha 
Shrine. Green Park Shin-totsukawa is located on the river terrace of 
the Ishikari River. The Shin-totsukawa Story Museum, a hot spring, and 
sports facilities are located on the park. #9 #10

#1  ``Shin-totsukawa Story (Shin-totsuawa-monogatari)'' is a novel for 
children. The novel was written between the 1970s and the 1980s. It 
depicts immigrants who moved to Hokkadou from Nara Prefecture. They 
moved because of a natural disaster (flood damage; See note No.3 
below).
	Shin-totsukawa Story was broadcast as a TV drama in the 1990s 
and gained popularity. It was before the expansion of the internet. 
Many children watched TV. (Today, children watch their smart-phones.)

#2  In late May, Mt. Pin-ne-shiri stands out when viewed from the 
Hokkaidou Expressway. The summit is covered with snow. The mountain is 
located at the border between Shin-totsukawa Town and Toubetsu Town. 
The name ``Pin-ne-shiri'' comes from ``pin-ne-sir'' in Ainu language. 
It means ``man, be, mountain.''
	Mt. Machine-yama is located near Mt. Pin-ne-shiri. The name 
``Machine'' comes from ``mat-ne-sir'' in Ainu language. It means 
``woman, be, mountain.'' (See Kimobetsu Town in Shiribeshi sub-
prefecture for Pin-ne-siri.)
	Mt. Pin-ne-shiri, Mt. Machine-yama, and Mt. Kumaneshiri are 
called Kabato three mountains. They are located on borders between
Shin-totsukawa, Toubetsu, Urausu, and Tsukigata towns.

#3  Totsukawa Village in Nara Prefecuture is the largest village in 
Japan (excluding towns and cities). The area occupies 672 square 
kilometers. (Tokyo 23 Wards are 622 square kilometers [62,200 
hectares].) It occupies one fifth of Nara Prefecture.
	After the major flood disaster in 1889, one fifth of the 
residents along the Totsukawa River immigrated to Hokkaidou. In 1890, 
six villages along the Totsukawa River merged and Totsukawa Village was 
established. After that, the area of Totsukawa Village is the same. 
	(Municipalities in Japan were merged and enlarged in the Shouwa 
period and the Heisei period. Many municipalities disappeared.)
	In Totsukawa Village, Tamaki Shrine and its pilgrimage roads 
are designated as World Heritage Site (Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage 
Routes in the Kii Mountain Range). The Totsukawa River flows south and 
empties into the Kumano Sea (Kumano-nada, Pacific Ocean).
	The name changes from the Totsukawa River to the Kumano-gawa 
River in the lower reaches of the river in Wakayama and Mie 
prefectures. (Also, the Yoshino River in Nara Prefecture changes to 
the Kino-kawa River in the downstream Wakayama Prefecture.)

#4 The first Colonial Rectangular Land Division (Shokuminchi-kukaku) 
was set in Tokku wilderness (Tokku-guen-ya). The name ``Tokku'' means 
``protruding'' in Ainu language. The second Colonial Rectangular Land 
Division was set in Nae wilderness (Nae-guen-ya) in what is now Naie 
Town, Sorachi sub-prefecture.
	Colonial Rectangular Land Divisions were set only in Hokkaidou 
Prefecture. It was during the Meiji period. Colonial Rectangular Land 
Division is similar to Township in the USA. Both land divisions have 
straight roads stretching along rectangular plots. However, in 
Hokkaidou, the roads do not run in a north-south direction.
	A large plot (``dai-kukaku'') of Colonial Rectangular Land 
Division is 900-ken on a side. ``900-ken'' is equivalent to 15-chou or 
1,620 meters.) A middle plot (``chuu-kukaku'') is 300-ken on a side. 
``300-ken'' is equivalent to 5-chou or 545 meters.
 	In the cases of the Ishikari Plain and the Tokachi Plain, five 
families settled in the middle plot of Colonial Rectangular Land 
Division. The area of a middle plot is about 30 hectares (545 x 545 
meters = 297,025 square meters). Each settler owned six hectares of 
land and cultivated grains, beans, and vegetables.
	As for grain cultivation in the past, in the case of the 
Ishikari Plain, farmers cultivated millet (``awa''), glutinous proso 
millet (``ina-kibi''), and rice. In the case of the Tokachi plain, 
farmers cultivated millets. Farmers in both area also cultivated 
corn (maize), potatoes, and beans.
	Agricultural mechanization progressed in the 1970s. The number 
of farms decreased. The average farm size in 2010 is 14 hectares in the 
Ishikari Plain and 38 hectares in the Tokachi Plain (by Census of 
Agriculture). The average of Honshuu island is 1.6 hectares.
	* * *
	In the case of American Township, one section of a rectangular 
land division is one mile on a side. One mile is equivalent to 1,600 
meters.
	A quarter section is a quarter mile on a side. A quarter mile 
is equivalent to 800 meters. A quarter section is 64 hectares. It was 
the land an immigrant could acquire in the western part of the USA (by 
N. Yagasaki et al. eds. 2003. ``American High Plains.'' Kokon-shoin. 
ISBN 4772215727.)
	Immigrants in the USA engaged in animal husbandry and 
agriculture. The combination is Western culture. McDonald's hamburgers
represent the culture (wheat and cattle).

#5  The administrative office (``kochou-yakuba'') of Shin-totsukawa 
village was one of the first administrative offices in the middle and 
upper reaches of the Isikari River. It also served as the adminstrative 
office of Uryuu village and Fukagawa village.
	(Uryuu village at the time covered what is now Uryuu Town, 
Hokuryuu Town, and Numata Town. Fukagawa village at the time covered 
what is now Fukagwa City, Chippubetsu Town, and Moseushi Town.)
	These are the opening years of administrative offices in the 
middle and upper reaches of the Ishikari River;
	(1) Tsukigata village in 1881 (Meiji 14), (2) Iwamizawa 
villages in 1884 (Meiji 17), (3) Ichikishiri village (now Mikasa City 
and Bibai City) in 1884 (Meiji 17), (4) Shin-totsukawa village in 1890 
(Meiji 23), and (5) Takikawa village in 1890 (Meiji 23).

#6  The first immigrants in Shin-totsukawa cultivated mainly flax as 
cash crop. In 1897 (Meiji 30), flax suffered heavy damage due to 
Youtou-mushi (armyworm caterpillars). After that, they changed the main 
crop to paddy rice. The word ``Yotou-mushi'' means ``night, steal, 
worm'' in Japanese. The bug appears at night from the ground.

#7  National Route 275 runs on the west bank (right bank) of the 
Ishikari River. The highway is called the back road (``ura-kaidou'').
(The main road [``omote-kaidou''] is National Route 12 on the east bank 
of the Ishikari River.)
	 National Route 275 has fewer traffic lights, allowing drivers 
to travel at higher speeds. Residents in Takikawa City use this highway 
to travel to Sapporo. (Police officers checks for speeding on the back 
road. Car accidents occur in winter because whiteout conditions 
happen.)

#8  When I participated in an excursion, I heard this, ``Shin-totsukawa 
is the terminal of the Sasshou Line. Children can commute to three high 
schools by bicycle (Shin-totsukawa Agriculture High School, Takikawa 
High School, and Takikawa West High School). Housing prices are low. 
Real estate companies recommend this place.''

#9  As for Izumo-taisha shrine, all of the immigrants who moved to 
Shin-totsukawa in 1890 were followers of the Izumo-taisha religion. 
	Izumo-taisha shrine is located in Kikusui district. The name 
``Kiku-sui'' is Japanese. It means ``chrysanthemum, water.''
        Kikusui district in Shin-totsukawa refers Masakatsu Kusunoki, 
who was a warlord in the 14th century. He lived in Totsukawa, Yamato-
no-kuni (now Nara Prefecture). His family crest was Kikusui. The 
design is like this;

Sunagawa [su-na-ga-wa] [\u7802\u5DDD] is a city in Sorachi sub-
prefecture, central Hokkaidou (``dou-ou''). It is located in the east 
bank (left bank) of the Ishikari River. The Sorachi River meets the 
Ishikari River to the north.
	The name ``suna-gawa'' means ''sand, river'' in Japanese. It is 
a translation of ``ota-us-nay'' in Ainu language, which means ``sand, 
exist, river.'' It signifies the Penke-utashinai River and the Panke-
utashinai River. In Ainu language, ``penke'' means ``up'' and `
`panke'' means ``down.''
 	In 1887 (Meiji 20), a road opened between Ichikishiri (now 
Mikasa City) and Asahikawa. The road was constructed by about 500 
prisoners (See Tsukigata Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for prisoners.) 
	Sunagawa became a hub of road and river transportation. In 
1890 (Meiji 23), Nae village was established in what is now Sunagawa 
City. The administrative office (``kochou-yakuba'') was co-operated in 
Takikawa village.
	In 1891 (Meiji 24), Sunagawa Station and Naie Station on the 
Hokkaidou Colliery Railway (now the Hakodate Main Line) opened. In 
1895 (Meiji 28), an administrative office was built in Nae village.
	In 1897 (Meii 30), Utashinai village was separated from Nae 
village. (Utashinai village covered the area what is now Utashinai 
City, Ashibetsu City, and Akabira City.) In 1902 (Meiji 35), Nae 
Village (2nd-class municipality) was established. (See the note of
Nanporo Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.)
	In 1903 (Meiji 36), the name changed from Nae to Sunagawa. In 
1907 (Meiji 40), Sunagawa Village (1st-class municipality) was 
established. In 1923 (Taishou 12), Sunagawa Town was established.
	In 1944 (Shouwa 19), Naie Village was separated (now Naie 
Town). In 1949 (Shouwa 24), Kami-sunagawa Town was separated. In 1958 
(Shouwa 33), Sunagawa City was established.
	The city hall of Sunagawa is located between the Penke-
utashinai River and the Panke-utashinai River. National Route 12 
(Chuuou-kokudou) and the Hakodate Mein Line pass. The national highway 
is the longest straight road in Japan. (See Yuni Town in Sorachi sub-
prefecture for straight roads.)
	In the past, Sunagawa was a hub for coal transportation. The 
Utashinai Line and the Sunagawa Branch Line branched off from Sunagawa 
Station on the Hakodate Main Line. The population of Sunagawa peaked 
at 44,443 in 1948 (by Sunagawa City). Sunagawa flourished with coal 
mines in the Yuubari mountains. #1 #2
	Distinctive industries in Sunagawa are manufacturing, power 
generation, commerce, and sightseeing. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = 
paddy rice 474 hectares in 2015, buckwheat 275, onions 116, pasture 87, 
fodder 77, tomatoes 20, orchards 11, flowers 7, cucumbers 2, 
	(continued) --> adzuki beans 1, radishes 1, Chinese cabbage 1, 
cabbage 1, other vegetables 9, and other grains 3; dairy cows 363 head 
in 2015.
	Factories in Sunagawa produce souvenirs from Hokkaidou; (1) 
Hori makes Yuubari Melon Pure Jelly, (2) Kitakarou makes Kaitaku-okaki 
(pioneers' rice cracker), and (3) Somes Saddle makes harness and bags. 
Also, Mitsui Chemical produces adhesives and ammonia water. Ouji 
Cornstarch, which is a company of Mitsui group, produces starch.
	As for power generation, Sunagawa Thermal Power Plant is 
operated by Hokkaidou Electric Power Company (Hokuden). The chimneys 
stand out from the Hokkaidou Expressway. There is another thermal 
power plant in neighboring Naie Town. #3
	Small local shops are open along National Route 12 in Sunagawa. 
In neighboring Takikawa City, small local shops closed. Considering its 
population, Sunagawa has many confectionery shops. ``Sunagawa Sweet 
Road'' is a project for revitalizing the city. In the past, coal miners 
bought a lot of sweets.
	The country sign (gateway sign) shows Sunagawa Reservoir and 
Hokkaidou Children's Country (Hokkaidou-kodomo-no-kuni). The reservoir 
is located downstream of the Panke-utashinai River. It is used for 
yachting, canoeing, and fishing. It used to be an ox-bow lake of the 
Ishikari River.
	Hokkaidou Children's Country is a recreational facility. It is 
connected to a service area on Hokkaidou Expressway. There are 
a pyramid, Torre di Pisa, and Lighthouse of Pharos.

#1  Upstream of Sunagawa are Utashinai City and Kami-sunagawa Town. In 
Utashinai, large companies such as Sumitomo, Mitsui, and Hokutan 
operated coal mines. (``Hokutan'' is ``Hokkaidou Colliery and 
Steamship,'' which is a company of Mitsui group.)
	In Kami-sunagawa, there was the main coal mine of Mitsui. On 
paydays for these companies, shopping streets in Sunagawa were 
bustling. (See Kami-sunagawa Town and Yuubari City in Sorachi sub-
prefecture for coal mining.)

#2  Sunagawa is the hometown of a writer who published a short tale 
``Ippai-no-kakesoba (One bowl of simple buckwheat noodle).'' The story
is like this;
	``Every year at the end of the year, a mother and two children 
came to a soba (buckwheat noodle) shop in Sapporo. (Japanese people eat 
buckwheat noodle at the end of the year.)
	The mother ordered one bowl of simple soba. (Nowadays, people 
order soba with tempura [deep-fried seafood and vegetables] rather than 
simple one [kake-soba].)
	The three people shared one bowl of soba. The shop owner knew 
she was poor. He served a large helping for the same price.
	Twenty years later, the two children grew up. They and their 
mother visited the same soba shop. They ordered three bowls of soba.'' 
(See Hidaka Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture for child-rearing.)
 
#3  There are thermal power plants in Sunagawa City and Naie Town.
They are inland thermal power plants. (Generally, thermal power plants 
in Japan are located along the coast.) They use coal from the Yuubari 
Mountains and cooling water from rivers. 
	Almost all underground coal mines were closed, however, open-
pit small coal mines still open. They are located in Ashibetsu City, 
Utashinai City, Mikasa City, Bibai City in Sorachi sub-prefecture, and 
Obira Town in Rumoi sub-prefecture. (The last underground coal mine in 
the country is in operation in Kushiro City.)
 	The coal from open-pit mines is used mainly in the inland 
thermal power plants and paper mills. In the 2000s, due to the rise of 
oil prices, the output of open-pit coal mines increased. 
	In the USA and Canada, shale gas and oil sands mining 
increased at the time. The energy efficiency of coal changes in 
relation to oil prices (by T. Nihei 2000. Energy efficiency of crop 
production in Japan, 1970-1990. ``Geographical Review of Japan'' 
http://www.researchgate.net/publication/272277534).
	Once, I visited the Coal Museum in Yuubari City and thought, 
``What was the energy efficiency of coal when people used pickaxes?'' 
Once, professor Hiroshi Hata (the director of Hokkaidou University 
Ranch) said, ``I wonder what the energy efficiency of the bird is 
like?'' At the time, we were on an excursion and saw a woodpecker.
	* * *
	In the past, high-quality coal from underground shafts were 
used for home stoves. Even though high-quality coal was used, stoves 
emitted smog. Children in Sapporo did not go out much during the 
winter.
	After an energy revolution, home heating changed from coal to
oil. It is changing to electricity now. The demand of electricity peaks 
in winter in Hokkaidou. It peaks in summer in Tokyo.

Kami-sunagawa [ka-mi-su-na-ga-wa] [\u4E0A\u7802\u5DDD] is a town in 
Sorachi sub-prefecture. It is located in the Yuubari Mountains. Forests 
occupy 88 percent of the area. The area is the upper reaches of the 
Panke-utashinai River. (The source of the river is located in Utashinai 
City.)
	Kami-sunagawa is located in the upper reaches of Sunagawa City. 
Kami-sunagawa Town is the smallest municipality in Hokkaidou. The area 
is about half the size of Lake Shikotsu.
	The name ``Kami-sunagawa'' means ``upper, Sunagawa'' in 
Japanese. The name ``suna-gawa'' means ''sand, river.'' It is a 
translation of ``ota-us-nay'' in Ainu language, which means ``sand, 
put, river.'' It signified the Panke-utashinai River and the Penke-
utashinai River. (See Sunagawa City for the rivers.)
	In 1897 (Meiji 30), immigrants from Uzura Village in Fukui 
Prefecture settled in Nae village. Nae village at the time covered 
what is now Sunagawa City, Utashinai City, Kami-sunagawa Town, and Naie 
Town. There are two Uzura districts today. One is located in Kami-
sunagawa Town and the other is located in Sunagawa City.
	In 1914 (Taishou 3), Mitsui Sunagawa Coal Mine started 
operations. In 1918 (Taishou 7), a railroad opened for coal 
transportation. (Later, the railroad became the Kami-sunagawa Line of 
JR Hokkaidou.)
	In 1949 (Shouwa 24), Kami-sunagawa Town was established. The 
area was separated from Sunagawa Town and Utashinai Town. (See Yuubari 
City in Sorachi sub-prefecture for coal mining.) #1 #2 #3
	The town hall of Kami-sunagawa is located along the valley of 
the Panke-utashinai River. There is no national highway or railway. In 
the past, the Kami-sunagawa Line ran. The population peaked at 31,406 
in 1950 (by population census). #4
	Distinctive industry in Kami-sunagawa is manufacturing, 
including shiitake mushroom factories. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = - 
(zero) for all crops and animals in 2015.
	Factories were attracted after the decline of coal mining. 
Manufacturing factories produce cutlery, semiconductors, and food. The 
food industries include shiitake mushroom, breadcrumbs (``panko''), and 
materials for shiitake mushroom cultivation such as bulk substrates 
(``kin-shou'') and wood logs (``hoda-gui'').
	As for sightseeing, the Kami-sunagawa Coal Museum is located 
near the town hall. Kami-sunagawa-dake Hot Spring is located in the 
upstream of the Panke-utashinai River.
	On the former site of Mitsui Sunagawa Coal Mine, a zero gravity 
experiment facility was established. Experiments were conducted using a 
shaft (``tate-kou'') with a drop of 710 meters. The altitude of the 
coal mine was 120 meters. The facility was operated between 1991 and 
2003.

#1  In 1896 (Meiji 29), Mitsui Mining Company started geological 
surveys. In 1914 (Taishou 3), Mitsui Sunagawa Coal Mine started coal 
mining in 1914 (Tashou 3). In 1987 (Shouwa 62), coal mining ended.
	It was said, ``One mountain, thirty thousand.'' This means that 
a large coal mine supported a population of 30,000. Large coal mines 
were managed by zaibatsu (huge conglomerate) such as Mitsui, Mitsubish, 
Sumitomo, and Hokutan. (Hokutan is a Mitsui group company). (See Mikasa 
City in Sorachi sub-prefecture for Sumitomo and Hokutan.) 
	In the case of Kami-sunagawa, it was also said, ``One company, 
one town.'' It means a town of Mitsui. In the past, miner's houses 
(``tan-juu'') were lined up from valleys to mountain slopes.
	In coal mine villages, the number of students in schools 
increased rapidly. Circus huts were set up at festivals. Concerts by 
famous singers started earlier than in Sapporo.

#2  When I read stories about coal miners, I remember stories about 
``garimpeiros'' (gold miners) in Brazil. These are quotes from the book 
``Tipos e aspectos do Brasil'' published by Fundacao Instituto 
Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica in 1975;
  ``A vida nos garimpos e regulada por um codigo nao escrito, mas 
    conhecido e por todos respeitados.''
  (Life in mines is regulated by a code that is not written, however, 
   people know it and respect it.)
  ``Joviais e cavalheirescos ao seu modo, os garimpeiros sao, por outro 
    lado, amantes da música e das danças.''
  (Jovial and chivalrous in their own way, the gold miners are, on the 
   other hand, lovers of music and dance.)
 
#3  Kami-sunagawa is the birthplace of the novelist Jun-ichi Watanabe. 
His famous works are the essay ``Donkan-ryoku (Unfeeling Power)'' and 
the novel ``Shitsu-rakuen (A Lost Paradise).'' He was the son of a 
mathematics teacher in a coal mining village. He became a doctor and 
then a novelist.

#4  The Kami-sunagawa Line was a branch of the Hakodate Main Line. In 
the 1981 film ``Eki (Station),'' a scene where Yoshimatsu is arrested 
was filmed at Kami-sunagawa Station. The scene also depicts a coal 
loading facility, which looks like a castle in the desert.

Utashinai [u-ta-shi-na-i] [\u6B4C\u5FD7\u5185] is a city in Sorachi 
sub-prefecture, central Hokkaidou (``dou-ou''). It is a small city in 
the Yuubari Mountains. It is located east of Sunagawa City. The Penke-
utashinai River and the Panke-utashinai River originate in Utashinai.
	The name ``Utashinai'' comes from ``ota-us-nay'' in Ainu 
language. It means ``sand, put, river.'' It signified the rivers of 
Penke-utashinai and Panke-utashinai. ``Penke'' means ``up,' and 
``Panke'' means ``down'' in Ainu language.
	In 1897 (Meiji 30), an administrative office (``kochou-
yakuba'') of Utashinai village was established. It was separated from 
Nae village (now Sunagawa City). The administrative office of Utashinai 
village also covered Furano village (now Kami-furano Town, Naka-furano 
Town and Furano City in Kamikawa sub-prefecture).
	In 1900 (Meiji 33), Ashibetsu village was separated. In 1909 
(Meiji 39), Utashinai Village (2nd-class municipality) was established. 
In 1919 (Taishou 8), Utashinai Village (1st-class municipality) was 
established. In 1922 (Taishou 11), Akabira Village was separated. (See 
the note of Nanporo Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.)
	In 1940 (Shouwa 15), Utashinai Town was established. In 1949 
(Shouwa 24), a part of the area was separated and became a part of 
Kami-sunagawa Town. In 1958 (Shouwa 33), Utashinai City was 
established.
	The city hall of Utashinai is located along the Penke-utashinai 
River. In the past, the Utashinai Line connected Utashinai and 
Sunagawa. Utashinai was developed as a city of coal mining. Large coal 
mines were run by Sumitomo and Hokutan (Hokkaidou Colliery and 
Steamship).
	The populaton peaked at 46,171 in 1948 (by Utashinai City). As 
the main energy source changed from coal to oil, large coal mines in 
Utashinai closed from the 1950s to the 1990s. Today, Utashinai is the 
least popuated city in the country. (See Yuubari City in Sorachi sub-
prefecture for coal mining.) #1 #2 #3 #4 #5 #6
	Distinctive industries in Utashinai are sightseeing and coal 
mining. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = orchards 6 hectares (grapes for 
wine) in 2015 and paddy rice - (zero); dairy cows - (zero) head in 
2015.
	As for sightseeing, there are Kamoidake International Ski 
Resort and Tyrolean Hot Spring. The city touts itself as ``The smallest 
city in the country.''
	The Kanashibetsu Romanza (movie theater) is a filming location 
for the 1970s film ``Shiawase-no-kiiroi-hankachi (The Yellow 
Handkerchief)'' and the 1980s TV drama ``Kinou, Kanashibetsu-de 
(Yesterday in Kanashibetsu).'' #7
	As for coal mining, although under-ground mines ended, an open-
pit coal mine continues. (See Sunagawa City in Sorachi sub-prefecture 
for open-pit coal mining.)

#1  These were underground coal mines in Utashinai;
(1) Sorachi Coal Mine by Hokutan (Hokkaidou Colliery and Steamship); 
    opened in 1890; closed in 1995. It was the last under-ground coal 
    mine in Sorachi sub-prefecture. It was the last coal mine of 
    Hokutan.
(2) Kami-utashinai Coal Mine by Sumitomo; discovered in 1888; opened 
    in 1895; merged with Sumitomo Akabira Coal Mine in 1953. (Sumitomo 
    Akabira Coal Mine in Alabira City was closed in 1994.)
(3) Utashinai Coal Mine by Sumitomo; opened in 1905 as Nakamura Coal 
    Mine; acquired by Sumitomo in 1928; gas explosion in 1969; gas 
    explosion in 1971; closed in 1971.
(4) Shin-utashinai Coal Mine by Sumitomo; opened in 1907 by Nihon-
    kougyou; acquired by Honbetsu Coal Mine in 1928; acquired by 
    Sumitomo Saka Coal Mine in 1928; closed in 1953; acquired by 
    Kobukuro-kougyou in 1957; closed in 1963.
(5) Mitsui-monju Coal Mine; opened in 1900 by three men; acquired by 
    Hokkai Coal Mine in 1908; acquired by Monju Coal Mine in 1912; 
    acquired by Tanaka-seisakusho in 1916; acquired by Mitsui in 1922; 
    closed in 1954.
	The name ``monju'' is Japanese. It comes from an old proverb, 
``san-nin-yore-ba-monju-no-chie (three person gather, the wisdom of 
Manjushiri [a bodhisattva of wisdom]).'' It means that the coal mine 
was started by three men (Toragorou Yuuki, Nisaburou Nishida, and 
Tomoichi Saitou).
 
#2  These are taboos of coal miners;
(1) Pouring miso-soup on the rice. --> It looks like a landslide.
    (The rice with miso-soup is called ``neko-man-ma [cat rice]''.) 
(2) Whistling in the mine shaft. --> The goddess of the mountain 
    loosens her grip and will cause a landslide. She loves music.
(3) Barking of dogs and calling of crows are different than usual. --> 
    You had better taking a day off.
(4) Taking back the leftover lunch (``bentou'') that you ate in the 
tunnel. --> You will bring the spirits of the dead into your home. You 
must abandon the leftover lunch in the tunnel.
	(The American song ``New York Mining Disaster 1941'' contains 
the lyric ``Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide.'')

#3  In World encyclopedia (Okudara et al. 2007), professor Jirou 
Okamoto wrote; ``Around 1873, Takeaki Enomoto discovered coal deposits 
in Utashinai. In 1890, Hokkaidou Colliery Railway opened Sorachi Coal 
Mine. In 1891, a railway connecting Utashinai and Iwamizawa opened.
 	The built-up area of Utashinai was flourished around the 
station. Utashinai was a typical coal mining town. In 1948, 12 coal 
mines were in operation, including two major companies, Hokutan and 
Sumitomo.''
	* * *
	Takeaki Enomoto was the commander of the Tokugawa Shogunate 
forces. After the defeat in the Boshin War, his life was spared, he was 
ordered to serve in Hokkaidou. He had studied in the Netherlands. (See 
Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for Takeaki Enomoto.)
	Takeaki Enomoto also spoke English. Takeaki Enomoto and Horace 
Capron, who was an American advisor in Hokkaidou, did not have a good 
relationship. (See Chuuou Ward in Sapporo City, Ishikari sub-
prefecture, for Horace Capron.)

#4  A novelist Doppo Kunikida visited Utashinai in 1895 (Meiji 28). He 
published ``Sorachi-gawa-no-kishibe (Banks of the Sorachi River)'' in 
1902 (Meiji 35). It was a travelogue. The part goes like this;
	``The train arrived at the valley of Utashinai. The rain had 
stopped. The sun was about to set. I left the station and looked for an 
inn.
	Several innkeepers were inviting guests. It was a place that 
supported thousands of miners. Hundreds of houses were clustered in a 
narrow valley.'' (See Akabrira City in Sorachi sub-prefecture for Doppo 
Kunikida.)
 
#5  Agriculture and agricultural cooperatives are the main industries 
in rural Hokkaidou. In Utashinai, however, there is no agricultural 
cooperative, because there is almost no arable land. It is said that 
the largest workplace is the city hall.
 	Why Utashinai City remains a small city? The answers are; (1) 
Because the status of a city cannot be reverted to the status of a 
town or a village. (2) Because there were no municipalities that 
merged with the financially struggling municipality.
	The web-page of Utashinai City includes the vacant house bank. 
Also, the city enacted a settlement promotion ordinance; ``1.5 million 
yen for new housing'' and ``2 million yen for moving in'' (as of 2018). 
I would like to live in the small city for about two years.

#6  As the coal mine industry declined, the city invited manufacturing 
companies. One of them was the Orient Leather that opened in 1964. 
Orient Leather aimed to export high-quality horse harnesses. It 
employed craftsmen in Hokkaidou.
	(Horse harness craftsmen supported agriculture in Hokkaidou 
when horses were used. Tractors replaced horses in the 1960s and the 
1970s.)
	The name of the company was changed from Orient Leather to 
Somes Saddle. The head office was moved to neighboring Sunagawa City. 
The company sells bags, wallets, and saddles.
	Utashinai Kousan Co. was established as a subsidiary of Hokutan 
(Hokkaidou Colliery and Steamship). The company started businesses in 
glass processing, grape cultivation for wine, and poultry farming. The 
poultry farming was discontinued. The vineyard was donated to the city.
	Utashinai Kousan succeeded the imported glass business from 
Hokutan. (Hokutan is a Mitsui group company.) Utashinai Kousan imports 
glass from Saint Gobain [san-goban] in France and processes double-
layered glass and triple-layered glass for homes and offices in 
Hokkaidou.
	It is difficult for new companies to start manufacturing glass 
in Japan. The top three companies occupy 90 percent of the market 
share. They are AGC (Asahi Glass Co., a Mitsubishi group company), 
Nippon Sheet Glass (a Sumitomo group company), and Central Glass. 
(Central Glass produces automotive glass with Saint Goban.) 
 
#7  The Kanashibetsu Romanza was a welfare facility for coal miners. 
It opened in 1953. The name was Sumitomo Kamiuta Hall. It hosted 
movies, plays, and concerts. Famous singers visited mining villages at 
first, and then large cities. Mining villages were important.
 	In 1971, a gas explosion happened, killing 30 miners. 
Sumitomo's Utashinai Coal Mine was closed. The Sumitomo Kamiuta Hall 
was abolished.
	After being featured in a movie and a TV drama, local 
volunteers started conservation in 1985. There is a coffee shop in the 
Kanashibetsu Romanza.

Uryuu [u-ryu-u] [\u96E8\u7ADC] is a town in Sorachi sub-prefecture, 
central Hokkaidou (``dou-ou''). The area stretches west of the Uryuu 
River and the Ishikari River. The western part of the town is the 
Mashike Mountains. Mt. Shokanbetsu (1,492 meters) rises.  
	The name ``Uryuu'' comes from ``urir-o-pet'' in Ainu language. 
It means ``cormorant, many, river.'' Cormorant is called ``u'' in 
Japanese. It signified the Uryuu River.
	In 1889 (Meiji 22), Uryuu Farm was established. It was a huge 
farm. It occupied 49,500 hecaters in the north of the Ishikari Basin. 
The area covered what is now Uryuu Town, Hokuryuu Town, Moseushi Town, 
Numata Town, and part of Fukagawa City. It was an aristocratic farm 
(peerage cooperative farm, ``kazoku-noujou [\u83EF\u65CF\u8FB2
\u5834]'' in Japanese). #1 #2
	In 1897 (Meiji 30), an administrative office (``kochou-
yakuba'') of Uryuu village was established. In 1915 (Taishou 4), Uryuu 
Village (2nd-class municipality) was established. In 1961 (Shouwa 36), 
Uryuu Town was established. (See the note of Nanporo Town for 2nd-class 
municipality.)
	The town hall of Uryuu is located near the confluence of the 
Uryuu River and the Ishikari River. National Route 275 runs. In the 
past, the Sasshou Line ran. #3
	Distinctive industries in Uryuu are paddy rice cultivation and 
sightseeing. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 2,362 hectares in 
2015, buckwheat 334, wheat 108, beans (soybeans 29, adzuki beans 7), 
	(continued) --> melons 7, onions 2, watermelons 2, flowers 2, 
fodder 1, green onions 1, broccoli 1, tomatoes 1, and other vegetables 
12+X (concealed); dairy cow - (zero) head in 2015.
	Uryuu rice is delicious. It is cultivated with abundant 
meltwater from Mt. Shokanbetsu. As for sightseeing, Uryuu-numa Marsh is 
located at the slope of Mt. Shokanbetsu. Tourists enjoy flowers. In a 
historical park, an old building of Hachisuka Farm (the former Uryuu 
Farm) is preserved. There are large red pine trees in the park. #4 #5

#1  Uryuu Farm was established under the Land Grant Act in the Meiji 
period. The act was the so-called Large-land Disposal Law (daitochi-
shobun-hou).
	The owners of the farm were; (1) Sanjou Sanetomi, a court noble 
(``kugue'') in Kyouto, (2) Mochiaki Hachisuka, a duke (``kou-shaku'') 
and the former lord of the Tokushima Domain, and (3) Yukisue Kikutei, a 
court noble in Kyouto. (The place name ``Kikusui'' in Sapporo City 
is related to Yukisue Kikutei.)
	The investors were; (1) Toda Yasuhiro, a viscount (``shi-
shaku'') and the son of the lord of the Matsumoto Domain, (2) Ootani 
Kouei, an earl (``haku-shaku'') and the head priest of Higashi-honganji 
Temple, and (3) Okitomo Akimoto, a viscount and the former senior 
retainer (``karou'') of the Utsunomiya Domain (by ``Uryuu-chou-shi 
[Uryuu Town history] published in 1969.)
	They intended to practice Western-style agriculture. 
Development started in 1890 (Meiji 23). In the year, prisoners from 
Kabato Prison (Kabato-shuuchi-kan) cleared 125 hectares. They cut 
trees, dug ditches, constructed bridges and buildings, and cultivated 
crops.
	The arable land in the first year was 105 hectares. The crops 
were corn (38 hectares), rye (19), soybeans (18), adzuki beans (4), 
sugar beets, vegetables, potatoes, and buckwheat.
 	Roads that connected Kabato (now Tsukigata), Fukagawa, Mashike 
were constructed by prisoners. Immigrants moved to Uryuu Farm as tenant 
farmers.
	In the early days of development, farmers also sold forestry 
products such as timbers, matchsticks, and railroad sleepers. Those 
were exported to Naichi (Honshuu island) and the Chinese continent.
	The office of Uryuu Farm was located at the current bus stop 
``Kyuu-shigai (old town).'' It is near the Ishikari River. (See Niki 
Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for large farms in the Meiji period.)
 	In the Meiji period, paddle-wheel steamers moved on the 
Ishikari River. The main river ports were Ishikari, Ebetsu, and 
Sorachi-buto (now Takikawa). (See Takikawa City in Sorachi sub-
prefecture for paddle-wheel steamers.)
	Farmers who worked for Uryuu Farm boarded paddle-wheel steamers 
and headed to Takikawa. From Takikawa, they crossed the Ishikari River 
by boat, followed a path surrounded by grass, and entered Uryuu Farm.

#2  In 1891 (Meiji 24), Sanetomi Sanjou died of influenza at the age of 
53. It was during Russian influenza pandemic. He was the most 
influential owner of Uryuu Farm. In 1893 (Meiji 26), Uryuu Farm was 
dismantled.
	In Uryuu Town, three farms were established on the site of 
Uryuu Farm; (1) Hachisuka Farm, which had 3,164 hectares of flat land 
and 3,000 hectares of mountains, (2) Toda Farm, which had 1,231 
hectares of flat land, and (3) Machimura Farm, which had 50 hectares of 
arable land and 30 hectares of pasture.
	(The average cultivated land per farm is 23 hectares in 
Hokkaidou and 1.6 hectares for the rest of Japan; according to 2010 
Census of Agriculture.)
	In Hachsuka Farm, in 1893 (Meiji 26), tenant farmers cultivated 
adzuki beans (70 hectares), corn (21), wheat (21), oats (16), and 
pasture (11). The cumulative revenue of Hachisuka Farm was in the red 
for 11 years (from 1893 to 1903).
	Hachisuka Farm and Toda Farm were owned by absentee landlords, 
while Machimura Farm was managed by Kin-ya Machimura, who was the 
former manager of Uryuu Farm. Kin-ya Machimura started dairy farming in 
Machimura Farm.
	The three farms gradually opened up their land to tenant 
farmers. The opportunity arose from disputes between landlord and 
tenant (``kosaku-sougui'') that continued from 1920 to 1932. The Hokkai 
Times reported, ``Peasants uprising. 150 tenant farmers stormed 
Hachisuka Farm office. The situation is not easy.''
	In 1917, Hirotaka Machimura, who was a son of Kin-ya Machimura, 
opened Machimura Farm in Tarukawa (now Ishikari City). In 1928, the 
farm moved from Tarukawa to Tsuishikairi (now Ebetsu City). In 1944, 
Machimura Farm in Uryuu Village was disbanded. (See Ebetsu City in 
Ishikari sub-prefecture for Machimura Farm.)
	After World War II, Hachisuka Farm and Toda Farm were disbanded 
due to post-war agrarian reform (``nouchi-kaihou'') led by Douglas 
MacArthur and the Allied Powers. (See Niki Town in Shiribeshi sub-
prefecture for large farms in the Meiji period.)

#3  There was Ishikari-oiwake Station on the Sasshou Line. A monument 
commemorating the station is located near Uryuu Rice Center. The name 
``Oiwake'' is Japanese, which means ``junction.''
 	Ishikari-oiwake was a junction of old roads that led to 
Ishikari country (Ishikari-koku) and Teshio country (Teshio-koku). The 
roads were constructed by prisoners from Tsukigata Prison. (The name 
``Oiwake'' is also located in Abira Town, Iburi sub-prefecture, and in 
Sapporo City, Ishikari sub-prefecture.)
 
#4  I visited Uryuu Rice Center in 2015. The facility is managed by 
Kita-sorachi Japan Agricultural Cooperatives. It was during a bus 
excursion that was organized by Hokkaidou Geographical Society. In 
Uryuu Rice Center, I heard the following;
	``The main rice varieties in Uryuu Town are Nanatsu-boshi (55 
percent of planted rice), Yume-pirika (20), and Kirara 397 (20). 
(Kirara 397 is the first famous rice variety from Hokkaidou; See Note 
No. 6 below.)
	(According to Japan Grain Inspection Association, the taste of 
Nanatsu-boshi was ranked as Special A, the highest grade, in 2010 and 
2011. The taste of Yume-pirika was also ranked as Spacial A in 2011 and 
2012. In the past, only Uonuma-koshihikari from Niigata Prefecture was 
ranked as Special A. The standards may have changed.)
	The abundant snowmelt water from Mt. Shokanbetsu makes Uryuu 
rice delicious. Some people say that global warming is good for paddy 
rice cultivation in Hokkaidou, however, in this town, the amount of 
snowfall is important. The more snow on the mountain, the tastier the 
rice becomes.
	(The same thing can be said to Uonuma-koshihikari in Niigata 
Prefecture. The abundant melt water from the Echigo Mountains, 
including Mt. Hakkaisan, makes the rice delicious.)
	The agricultural cooperative maintains the deliciousness of the 
rice. For example, they sell Yume-pirika after polishing rice (``sei-
mai''). They do not sell brown rice of Yume-pirika, because ordinary 
polishing machine deteriorate the taste.
	The rice is also preserved with the latest storage technology.
It is a low-temperature storage method that is developed by the Faculty
of Agriculture, Hokkaidou University.
	They do not put the name `Uryuu-mai (Uryuu rice)' for the rice 
cultivated after other crops. (This means that the rice cultivated by 
crop rotation is omitted from the regular distribution.) Also, the rice 
cultivated on peatland is inferior.''
	The name of the grain elevator of Kita-sorachi Japan 
Agricultural Cooperatives is Shokan-no-tou (The Tower of Mt. 
Shokanbetsu).

#5  A brief history of rice cultivation in Uryuu Town is as follows (by 
``Uryuu- chou-shi [Uryuu Town history]'' published in 1969); In 1893, 
Hachisuka Farm surveyed the possibility of irrigation from the 
Oshirarika [\u5C3E\u767D\u5229\u52A0] River. In 1904, irrigation canals 
and paddy fields were established.
	In 1910, paddy rice cultivation expanded due to the direct 
seeding (``jika-maki'') method. The main varieties at the time were 
Kurogue-wase (black hair, early ripening) and Bouzu (no hair or monk.)
	For direct seeding, heavy seeds were selected by floating them 
in salt water. Bouzu was good because it sank into the mud. Awns 
(``nogui'' or ``nogue'''] [\u8292 or \u91CE\u6BDB] of Bouzu were very 
short. (See Kita-hiroshima City in Ishikari sub-prefecture for Akague 
[red hair].)
	In the Taishou period (from 1913 to 1926), Uryuu was known as 
``Uryuu of Rice.'' However, poor harvests continued; In 1912, crop 
failure by low temperatures. In 1913, crop failure. In 1926, crop 
failure by unfavorable weather after spring. 
	(continued) --> In 1928, crop failure by hailstorm. In 1931, 
severe crop failure by low temperatures after spring. In 1932, severe 
crop failure by flooding. Farmers had to purchase government-disposed 
rice (``seifu-haraisague-mai''). In 1934, crop failure by low 
temperatures in August.
	(continued) --> In 1938, crop failure by drought. In 1940, 
crop failure by rice blast (``imochi-byou''). In 1941, crop failure by 
low temperatures. In 1943, crop failure by drought. In 1945, crop 
failure by unfavorable climate. In 1954, crop failure by typhoon.
	(continued) -->  In 1956, crop failure by low temperatures in 
summer. From 1964 to 1966, crop failures by low temperatures. 
	* * *
	Tenant farmers in the large Hachisuka Farm and Toda Farm 
cultivated not only paddy rice but also foxtail millet (``awa'') and 
glutinous proso millet (``ina-kibi'') for food.
	In 1968, the production of rice in Uryuu exceeded 200,000 hyou 
(12,000 tons). It was at the same level as current production. In the 
year, farmers established an organization to produce high-quality rice. 
They studied how to change from quantity to quality.
	 In 1985, the rate of 1st-class rice (``ittou-mai'') exceeded 
50 percent. In 1988, Kirara 397 became the recommended variety. In 
1989, the rate of 1st-class rice exceeded 70 percent.
	Today, the rate of 1st-class rice exceeds 90 percent. ``1st-
class rice'' is judged by the appearance of rice before polishing. 
``Special A,'' which was mentioned in Note 4 above, is judged by the 
taste of the cooked rice.
 
#6  These are delicious rice varieties in Hokkadou; (1) Kirara 397, 
cultivated from the early 1990s to the present, (2) Hoshino-yume, 
cultivated from the late 1990s to the early 2000s, (3) Nanatsu-boshi, 
cultivated from the early 2000s to the present, and (4) Yume-pirika, 
cultivated from the 2010s to the present.
	In the past, Hokkaidou rice was called ``neko-matagui (cat, 
step over).'' It means, ``such a tasteless rice that even cats would 
not eat.'' (See Utashinai City in Sorachi sub-prefecture for cat rice.)
	Kirara 397 changed the situation. It is delicious, whereas it 
is resistant to cold climate and rice blast. It can be cultivated 
even in peatland.
	Kirara 397 is still popular. It is sold mainly for commerce. 
Commerce rice is used in restaurants and lunch box shops. At first, 
Kirara 397 was used mainly at beef bowl chain restaurants.
	Nanatsu-boshi became popular after the 2000s. It is sold for 
home consumption. At last, Hokkadou rice is consumed in homes. Before 
the 2000s, urban residents in Hokkaidou purchased the rice cultivated 
in Honshuu island (``naichi-mai'').
	Rice for home consumption is more expensive than rice for 
commerce. It is sold at super markets. Rice for commerce includes 
imported rice. It is not sold in super markets.
	(See Pippu Town in Kamikawa sub-prefecture for Kirara 397 and 
Yume-pirika; See Iwamizawa City in Sorachi sub-prefecture for Nanatsu-
boshi; See Kita-hiroshima City in Ishikari sub-prefecture for old rice 
varieties; See Enbetsu Town in Rumoi sub-prefecture for rice 
consumption; See Kaminokuni Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for a crop 
failure in 1993.)
 
#7  As for Uryuu-numa Marsh, tourists enjoy seeing Mizu-bashou (skunk 
cabbage) in June, Ezo-kanzou (Hokkaidou daylily) in July, and Tachi-
guiboushi (large plantain lily) in August.
	In Japan, Mizu-bashou in Oze Marsh in Honshuu island is 
famous. The altitude of Oze Marsh is 1,400 meters. Uryuu-numa Marsh, 
whose altitude is 850 meters, is known as Oze of Hokkaidou.
	In Hokaidou, Mizu-bashou grows from zero meters altitude. In 
the case of Hokkaidou University, we can see the large leaves of Mizu-
bashou. They grow in the Sakushu-kotoni River that flows along Oono 
Pond. The altitude is 14 meters.
	There is a famous Japanese song ``Natsu-no-omoide (Memory of 
summer).'' Many Japanese people think that Mizu-bashou blooms in 
summer, because the song includes the lyrics ``flowers of Mizu-bashou 
bloom... far away Oze.'' However, Mizu-bashou blooms in early spring.
	 In Sapporo, Mizu-bashou blooms in early May. It is the same 
time as the cherry blossom. Although the English name of Mizu-bashou is 
``skunk cabbage,'' Japanese people have good images of the plant 
because of the song.
 
#8  The big red pine trees in the former Hachisuka Farm were 
transplanted from Honshuu island. Red pine trees are not native in 
Hokkaidou. Mochiaki Hachisuka, who was the owner of Hachisuka Farm, 
bought red pine seedlings from a temple in Tokyo. 
	(The temple is Kaizenji in Taitou Ward. The address is 
Matsugaya [pine tree valley]. There used to be pine trees.)
	Red pine trees in Hokkaidou island are ``thinking-of-hometown 
tree (bou-kyou-ju').'' (See Furubira Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture 
for thinking-of-hometown tree; See Nanae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture 
for red pine trees.)
 	In Japan, there are three good luck trees. They are pine, plum, 
and bamboo. In Japanese, pine is called ``matsu'' and plum is called 
``ume.'' I think ``matsu (pine)'' signifies ``matsu (wait)'' and 
``ume (plum)'' signifies ``ume (birth).'' Bamboo signifies growing 
straight.

Takikawa [ta-ki-ka-wa] [\u6EDD\u5DDD] is a city in Sorachi sub-
prefecture, central Hokkaidou (``dou-ou''). It is located at the 
confluence of the Ishikari River and the Sorachi River.
	The name ``Taki-kawa'' is Japanese. It means ''waterfall, 
river.'' It is a translation of ``so-rapci-pet'' in Ainu language, 
which means ``waterfall, complexly falling, river.'' The original 
place name of Takikawa was Sorachi-buto. #1
 	In the Meiji period, paddle-wheel steamers navigated on the 
Ishikari River. The terminal was Sorachi-buto (now Takikawa City). The 
port was constructed on a river terrace of the Ishikari River. The 
location was on the east bank (left bank). #2 #3
  	In 1890 (Meiji 23), Takikawa-tonden-heison (Takikawa military 
settlers' colony) was established. The administrative office (``kochou-
yakuba'') of Takikawa village was established. In 1898 (Meiji 31), 
Takikawa Station on the Governmental Hokkaidou Railway (now the 
Hakodate Main Line) opened. #4
 	In 1906 (Meiji 23), Takikawa Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established. In 1909 (Meiji 42), Takikawa Village (1st-class 
municipality) was established. Ebeotsu [\u6C5F\u90E8\u4E59] Village 
was established by separating from Takikawa. (See the note of Nanporo 
Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.)
	In 1910 (Meiji 43), Takikawa Town was established. In 1952 
(Shouwa 27), Ebeotsu Town was established. In 1958 (Shouwa 33), 
Takikawa City was established. In 1971 (Shouwa 46), Takikawa City 
merged Ebeotsu Town.
	The city hall of Takikawa is located near the confluence of the 
Ishikari River and the Sorachi River. National Route 12 (Chuuou-
kokudou) runs. The national highway is straight between Bebai City and 
Sunagawa City. Then, it turns 45 degrees west, crosses the Sorachi 
River, and enters Takikawa City.
	Near the city hall, National Route 38 (Ashibetsu-kokudou) 
branches off from National Route 12. The Nemuro Main Line branches off 
from the Hakodate Main Line. The bypass of National Route 12 opened in 
1990. It runs on the outskirts of the built-up area of Takikawa City. 
#5
 	Distinctive industries in Takikawa are agriculture, food 
processing, commerce, and sightseeing. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = 
paddy rice 2,191 hectares in 2015, wheat 796, buckwheat 455, beans 
(soybeans 179, adzuki beans 24, other beans 5), pasture 131,
	(continued) --> onions 54, orchards 30 (apples 23, plums 1, 
other fruits 1+X), tomatoes 6, green onions 5, fodder 4, cucumbers 3, 
flowers 3, melons 2, radishes 1, yams 1, other grans 117, and other 
vegetables 41+X (asparagus); dairy cows 191 head in 2015. #6
	Local specialties are onions, Aigamo duck (domestic duck), 
Jinguisu-kan (grilled mutton), rapeseed oil, and rape flower. The 
planted area of rape is 180 hectares in 2014. It is the largest in the 
country. Rape blooms from late May to early June. #7 #8 #9
	As for commerce, since Takikawa is a traffic hub in the middle 
reaches of the Ishikari River, national chain stores are located along 
suburban roads. Small local shops are closed. (They became the 
families' residence.) In contrast, small local shops are open in 
neighboring Sunagawa City.
	As for sightseeing, Takikawa Sky Park is located on the east 
bank of the Ishikari River. #10
  
#1  The word ``buto'' in place names means the confluence of rivers. It 
comes from ``puto'' in Ainu language. Sorachi-buto means the confluence 
of the Sorachi River and the Ishikari River. The location is the border 
between Takikawa City, Sunagawa City, and Shin-totsukawa Town. The 
border is winding. It was the meander of the old river.
	The etymology of ``meander'' is Maiandros. It means a god of 
the river in Greek mythology. In Japanese, meander is called ``da-kou 
[\u86C7\u884C].'' It means ``snake, go.''
 
#2  In 1892 (Meiji 25), Sorachi-buto Station on the Hokkaidou Colliery 
Railway opened. The station was located along the Sorachi River. The 
location was what is now Sunagawa City.
	In 1898 (Meiji 31), the railroad crossed the Sorachi River and 
led to Asahikawa. Takikawa Station opened and Sorachi-buto Station was 
closed. The railroad was what is now the Hakodate Main Line. 
	To the west of Takikawa Station was a river port. Paddle 
steamers and ferryboats arrived and departed from the port in the Meiji 
period. The former site of the port is now Hatoba Park (Pier Park).
	An iron bridge made in the UK spanned the Sorachi River. It was 
located between Takikawa Station and the former Sorachi-buto Station. 
The old iron bridge is now located between the Chitose River and Lake 
Shikotsu in Chitose City, Ishikari sub-prefecture.
 	In 1909 (Meiji 42), the Kushiro Line opened. The railway 
connected stations of Asahikawa, Kami-furano, Shimo-furano, Obihiro, 
and Kushiro. In 1913 (Taishou 2), the Kushiro Main Line opened. It 
connected stations of Takikawa, Shimo-furano, Obihiro, and Kushiro.
	After the opening of the Kushiro Main Line, the part between 
Asahikawa and Shimo-furano changed to the Furano Line. In 1921 (Taishou 
10), the railway was extended to Nemuro Station and was renamed the 
Nemuro Main Line. In 1942 (Shouwa 17), Shimo-furano Station was renamed 
Furano Station.
	The 1993 film ``Maadadayo (Not Yet)'' depicts a railway nerd 
reciting the names of every station from Nemuro Station to Nishi-
kagoshima Station.

#3  The paddle-wheel steamers on the Ishikari River resembled those on 
the Mississippi River in the USA. In the past, American engineers 
worked for Hokkaidou.
	Paddle steamers could navigate on shallow waters compared to 
screw ships. Nowadays, paddle wheelers navigate in Lake Biwa, Lake 
Tadami, and Tokyo Disneyland in the country. In the USA, paddle 
wheelers still navigate in the Mississippi River. These are for 
sightseeing tours.
	The paddle-wheel steamers on the Ishikari River were 
side-wheelers, as well as Susquehanna of United States Navy. 
(Susquehanna came to Japan in the 1850s. The commander Matthew Perry 
pressured the Tokugawa Shogunate to open Japanese ports; See Hakodate 
City in Oshima sub-prefecture for Matthew Perry.)
	Models of Paddle steamers are displayed at the Ebetsu City 
Museum and at Hamanasu Park in Ishikari City in Ishikari sub-
prefecture. A model of Susuquehanna is displayed in Shimoda City, 
Shizuoka Prefecture (HTTP://2242.MOOO.COM/POSI/95IZU/1483.JPG).
  
#4  In 1890 (Meiji 23), Takikawa-tonden-heison (Takikawa military 
settlers' colony) was established and 440 families immigrated. The 
location was what is now around the city hall.
	In 1894 (Meiji 27), Ebeotsu-toden-heison (Ebeotsu military 
settlers' colony) was established and also 400 families immigrated. The 
location was north of Takikawa. (See Fukagawa City and Chippubetsu 
Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for Tonden-hei [military settlers].)

#5  National Route 12 starts from Chuuou Ward in Sapporo City, Ishikari 
sub-prefecture. It runs parallel with the Hakodate Main Line. The 
terminal is the 4-jou [yo-jou] street of Asahikawa City, Kamikawa sub-
prefecture.
	National Route 38 starts from Takikawa City, Sorachi sub-
prefecture. It runs parallel with the Nemuro Main Line, passes the 
Furano Basin and the Tokachi Plain, and reaches Kushiro City, Kushiro 
sub-prefecture. The terminal is Nusamai Rotary.
	In the 1981 TV drama ``Kita-no-kuni-kara (From the North 
Country),'' Gorou's family moves from Tokyo to Hokkaidou. The first 
setting in Hokkadou is the Nemuro Main Line. Gorou and his child 
Hotaru look out the train window;
  Hotaru says, ``Kawa!'' (River!)
  Gorou says, ``Sorachi-gawa-da'' (Sorachi River.)

#6  The main varieties of rice in Takikawa are Nanatsu-boshi and Yume-
pirika. (See Uryuu Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for rice varieties.)
	Wheat is the second largest crop by area. Farmers cultivate 
wheat varieties for hard flour (``kyouriki-ko''). Those are Haru-yutaka 
and Haru-yo-koi. From locally produced hard flour, Takikawa ``ramen'' 
noodle is made.
	The word ``haru'' means ``spring'' in Japanese. Those are 
spring wheat varieties, whose seeds are sown in spring. Cultivating 
wheat varieties for hard flour is difficult.
	One reason is that it rains in the summer, during the harvest 
season. (Wheat can sprout on the ears when it rains during the harvest 
season.) Another reason is that the growing period of spring wheat is 
shorter than winter wheat.

#7  Onions (``tama-negui'') of Takikawa are sold with the brand name 
``Taki-tama.'' The onions are also processed into onion sauce. The 
onion sauce is also used in Jinguisu-kan (grilled mutton).
 	Apples are sold with the brand name ``Ebeotsu-ringo.'' The word 
``ringo'' in Japanese means ``apple.'' (The Beatles member Ringo Starr 
was named after Johnny Ringo, who was an outlaw in the USA.)

#8  Jinguisu-kan is grilled mutton. Matsuo Jinguisu-kan Co. sells 
seasoned mutton for barbecue. The head office is located in Takikawa 
City. The mutton is seasoned with a sweet sauce.
	There was Takikawa Sheep Ranch from 1906 to 2010. It was run by 
the Ministry of Agriculture. In the early 20th century, the government 
aimed to become self-sufficient in wool. Wool was used by the army, 
police officers, and railroad workers. The government launched the 
One Million Sheep Project.
	Japanese people started eating mutton. They did not like the 
smell of mutton. The governmental sheep ranch developed a sauce for 
grilled mutton. It was a sweet sauce. Raw mutton was dipped in the 
sauce and grilled. The sauce is the origin of Matsuo Jinguisu-kan.
	Grilled mutton was named ``Jinguisu-kan'' in the 1930s by a 
railroad officer, who worked for South Manchuria Railroad. Manchuria 
was located in what is now north China. Local people ate mutton hotpot. 
It was brought to Japan and named Jinguisu-kan after the Mongolian 
emperor Genghis Khan.
	The railroad officer was Tokuzou Komai, who graduated from 
Collage of Agriculture, Tohoku Imperial University (now Hokkaidou 
University). Before World War II, Japan occupied Manchuria. (After the 
war, Japan was occupied until 1952. [Bonin islands was occupied until 
1968 and Okinawa island was occupied until 1972].)
	Today, in Hokkaidou University, students and teachers enjoy 
Jin-pa, which is an abbreviation of Jinguisu-kan party. When I first 
heard the word, I imagined something like a dance party.
	Today, nearly 100 percent of the mutton consumed in Japan is 
imported from Australia and New Zealand. (See Toyohira Ward in Sapporo 
City, Ishikari sub-prefecture, and Shibetsu City in Kamikawa sub-
prefecture] for sheep.)
	As for sweet sauce, fish grilled in a sweet sauce is called 
``teri-yaki.'' McDonald's sells teri-yaki burgers. I think ``teri-
yaki'' is salty for the elderly people (like me). Westerners eat a lot 
of meat. The grilled meat is seasoned with a little salt (Nihei lab 
2025b).
 
#9  Rape is called ``abura-na'' in Japanese. It means ``oil, 
vegetable.'' Rape is also called ``na-tane'' in Japanese. It means 
``rape, seed.''
	The major producer of rape is Canada. Canola oil is the 
rapeseed oil that was developed in Canada. Japan imports 99 percent of 
rapeseed from Canada.
	Before kerosene lamps became popular, rapeseed oil was used in 
lamps. That was until the early 20th century. Before the liberalization 
of rapeseed imports in 1971, Japan was 100 percent self-sufficient in 
rape oil.
	In the past, rape was cultivated in paddy fields. It was 
cultivated before rice. An old song ``Oboro-zuki-yo (Hazy moonlit 
night),'' which was sung in elementary school, describes the rape 
flower fields in spring; 
``Nano-hana-batake-ni-irihi-usure, 
  (The sun sets over the rape flower fields),
  Miwatasu-yama-no-ha-kasumi-fukashi.
  (The edge of the mountain I look is hazy).''
	Rape flowers in paddy fields disappeared, however, rape 
cultivation revived in Takikawa City and Obihiro City as a crop to make 
landscape.
 
#10  Takikawa Sky Park includes a glider airfield, baseball fields, and 
golf courses. In 1981, the Ishikari River suffered major flood damage. 
The mayor inspected the flood dammag from the air.
	In the following year, a glider airfield opened. Projects to 
revitalize the city through sports started, including sky sports. 
As for baseball fields, Takikawa West Hgh School is strong in baseball.
(See Tomakomai City in Iburi sub-prefecture and Moseushi Town in 
Sorachi sub-prefecture for sports.)
	(Popular sports came from the UK and the USA, for example, 
baseball, soccer [football], volleyball, basketball, ice hockey, 
cricket, golf, and horse riding. Those people are geniuses at playing.)

(1990); COUNTRY SIGN = MINE SHAFT, MINE DUMP, STATION, & BURNING OF THE 
CHARACTER BIG.
  
Akabira [a-ka-bi-ra] [\u8D64\u5E73] is a city in Sorachi sub-
prefecture, central Hokkaidou (``dou-ou''). It is an inland city. The 
area is located in basin of the Sorachi River. The river cuts the 
Yuubari Mountans.
	The name ``Aka-bira'' is a mixture of the translation of an 
Ainu word with an original Ainu word. The word``aka'' means ``red'' in 
Japanese, which was translated from ``fure'' in Ainu language. The word 
``bira'' comes from ``pira'' in Ainu language, which means ``cliff.''
	The name ``Aka-bira'' means ``red, cliff.'' It signified that a 
cliff along the Sorachi River appeared red. (See Akaigawa Village in 
Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for place names including ``red.'')
 	In 1891 (Meiji 24), agricultural settlement started. In 1897 
(Meiji 30), the first road opened. In 1913 (Taishou 2), Akabira Station 
opened on the Kushiro Main Line (now the Nemuro Main Line). In 1922 
(Taishou 11), Akabra Village (2nd-class municipality) was established.
It was separated from Utashinai Village.
 	In 1929 (Shouwa 4), Akabira Village (1st-class municipality) 
was established. In 1943 (Shouwa 18), Akabra Town was established. In 
1954 (Shouwa 29), Akabira City was established. (See the note of 
Nanporo Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.)
	The city hall of Akabira is located along the Sorachi River. 
The Nemuro Main Line and National Route 38 (Ashibetsu-kokudou) pass. In 
the past, Akabira prospered from coal mining. The population peaked at 
58,713 in 1959 (by Akabira City). The major coal mines were; (1) 
Akabira Coal Mine, operated by Sumitomo group, closed in 1994, 
	(continued) --> (2) Akama Coal Mine, operated by Hokutan 
(Hokkaidou Colliery and Steamship), closed in 1973, (3) Yuubetsu 
Moshiri Coal Mine, operated by Mitsubishi group, closed in 1969, and 
(4) Toyosato Coal Mine, operated by Shouwa-denkou, closed in 1967. 
 	Distinctive industries in Akabira are manufacturing, 
agriculture, and sightseeing. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 
362 hectares in 2015, buckwheat 112, pasture 80, flowers 2 (green 
house), potatoes 1, tomatoes 1, other vegetables 7+X, and other grains 
1; dairy cows X (concealed) head in 2015.
	As for manufacturing, after the declining of coal mining, four 
industrial parks were established. The city government attracted 
factories of paper (tissue, toilet paper), food processing, 
woodworking, metal processing, and electronic parts.
	As for agriculture, roses and orchids are cultivated in 
greenhouses. Floriculture is possible in small land. Roses were printed 
on the former country sign (gateway sign). As for sightseeing, a shaft 
tower of a coal mine can be seen from Akabira Station. It is a 
landmark.
	Near the shaft tower, there is a tourist stairway on a mine-
dump mountain (``zuri-yama''). It features 777 steps and marks the 
longest stairway on a mine-dump mountain in the country. Visitors can 
observe the Sorachi River and the built-up area of Akabira City. 
(Visitors cannot climb the shaft tower.)
	Akabira Station is a six-story building. It looks like a 
Western castle. It was built in 1999. Kai-tan-ame, which means ``block 
coal candy,'' is a specialty of the city. It is a coal-like candy. The 
color comes from bamboo charcoal. It has been sold since 1932. #1 #2 #3 
#4 #5 #6 

#1  The mine shaft tower belonged to Akabira Coal Mine (closed). It 
sent miners 650 meters underground. (The altitude of Akabira is 55 
meters.) The length of mining tunnels reached 200 kilometers. A tunnel 
connected to a coal mine in Utashinai City.
	(Cf. The length of the Seikan Tunnel, which is an undersea 
tunnel, is 54 kilometers; See Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-prefecture 
for Seikan Tunnel.)
 
#2  A mine-dump mountain is called ``zuri-yama'' or ``zuri'' in 
Japanese. In Kyuushuu island, it is called ``bota'' or ``bota-yama''. 
``Zuri'' means stones and low-quality coal extracted from mines. They
were piled up for a long time and became a mountain. A mine-dump 
mountain can spontaneously combust.
	When I saw a mine-dump mountain, I remembered a proverb in 
Portuguese; ``Agua [\u00C1gua] mole em pedra dura tanto bate ate 
[at\u00E9] que fura. (Watar is soft. Constant dripping makes a hole on 
hard rock.)''

#3  There is a mining song called ``Tankou-bushi (Coal Mine Song).'' 
It comes from a coal mine village in Kyuushuu island. These are part of 
the lyrics; 
``Tsuki-ga-deta-deta, tsuki-ga-deta, yoi-yoi
  (The moon rose, the moon rose, yoi-yoi),
  Uchino-oyamano-ueni-deta
  (It rose above our coal mine.)''
	A mining village was a kind of utopia.

#4   In the past, railroads connected Akabira Station and nearby coal 
mines. In 1960, Akabira Station handled the largest freight in the 
country. Today, Akabira Station looks like a European castle. It 
includes not only the ticket gates but also Akabira City Community 
Center Mirai.
	The distance between Akabira Station and Sapporo Station is 97 
kilometers, using the Nemuro Main Line and the Hakodate Main Line. Both 
lines are operated by JR Hokkaidou. The fare is 1,900 yen for local 
trains and 3,550 yen for express trains (as of 2018). Local trains 
cost 19.6 yen per kilometer.
	In the case of Tokyo, where I live now, the fare between 
Shinjuku Station and Minami-oosawa Station is 390 yen. The line is 
operated by the Keiou Line. The distance is 34 kilometers. It costs 
11.5 yen per kilometer.

#5  In 2014, I bought a can of Kikusui (Kikusui-funaguchi), which is 
rice wine, at a convenience store in front of Akabira Station. 
Generally, rice wine at train stations is sold in glass cups or small 
paper boxes. Kikusui is sold in cans.
	Kikusui is produced in Niigata Prefecture. The alcohol content 
is 19 percent. Generally, the alchool content of rice wine is 15 
percent, because water is added. Kikusui is raw rice wine.
	The taste of raw rice wine changes by time. The Kikusui I 
bought in Akabira was seven months old. According to the explanation 
printed on the can, it was at the stage of ``Brandy (matured).'' The 
taste was good.
	When I buy Kikusui in Sapporo, the stage is always ``Fruit 
(fresh).'' (The stage of Fruit is from zero to two months; The stage of 
Brandy is from six months to one year; The stage of ``Laochuu [more 
matured]'' is after one year; See Asahikawa City in Kamikawa sub-
prefecture for rice wine.)
 	According to the company's web-page, the name ``Kikusui'' comes 
from the Nougaku (traditional theater) called ``Kiku-ji-dou.'' Kiku-ji-
dou is a story about ``xian'' in old China. (Xian is ``sen-nin'' in 
Japanese and hermit or wizard in Englishh.) The xian drunk dew on the 
leaves of chrysanthemum (``kiku''). He was 700 years old.
	Chrysanthemum is a flower that symbolizes longevity. It has 
been used for family crests and family names. It is also a flower 
associated with the dead.
	Chrysanthemum is displayed in Bon (mid August or mid June), 
Higan (equinox), and funerals. These are days to think about the dead. 
(See Shiroishi Ward in Sapporo City, Ishikari sub-prefecture, and Shin-
totsukawa Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for the name ``Kikusui.'')
  
#6  In Akabira City, there is a stone monument to the novelist Doppo 
Kunikida (1871-1908). Kunikida's most famous work is ``Musasino.'' 
Musashino is an upland in western Tokyo. He described the natural 
environment. His works are naturalism.
	In 1895 (Meiji 28), he visited the hills along the Sorachi 
River. He wanted to buy land to live freely. He wanted to live there 
with Nobuko. He wanted to marry with her, however her parents opposed.
	He was physically too weak to live in Hokkaidou during the 
pioneering period. He soon returned to Tokyo. He died of tuberculosis 
at the age of 36. (See Utashinai City in Sorachi sub-prefecture for his 
travelogue.)

#7  There is a castle along National Route 38. It is a Japanese style 
castle. It was a showroom for a doll company. Selling dolls is a 
seasonal business. Dolls for girls are displayed in March. Dolls for 
boys are displayed in May. The number of children decreased. 
	The castle was closed. By this time, surely tonight, snow is 
piling up on the roof, silently.

SUNFLOWER.
 
Hokuryuu [ho-ku-ryu-u] [\u5317\u7ADC] is a town in Sorachi sub-
prefecture, central Hokkaidou (``dou-ou''). It is located in the west 
bank (right bank) of the Uryuu River. The area extends from the 
Ishikari Plain to the Mashike Mountains, including Mt. Shokanbetsu 
(1,491 meters) #1
 	The name ``Hoku-ryuu'' means ``north, Uryuu.'' The name 
``Uryuu'' comes from ``urir-o-pet'' in Ainu language. It means 
``cormorant, many, river.'' (See Uryuu Town in sub-prefecture for the 
name ``Uryuu.'')
 	In 1893 (Meiji 26), Uryuu Farm was demolished. A group of 
immigrants from Chiba Prefecture (Chiba-dantai) immigrated. They were 
led by Baihon [\u57F9\u672C] Company. In 1897 (Meiji 30), a group of 
immigrants from Ishikawa Prefecture (Kaga-dantai) immigrated.
	In 1899 (Meiji 32), an administrative office (``kochou-
yakuba'') of Hokuryuu village was established. It was separated from 
Uryuu village. In 1914 (Taishou 3), Kami-hokuryuu village (now Numata 
Town) separated. #2
 	In 1915 (Taishou 4), Hokuryuu Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established. In 1961 (Shouwa 36), Hokuryuu Town was established. 
(See the note of Nanporo Town for 2st-class municipality.)
	The town hall of Hokuryuu is located near the confluence of the 
Uryuu River and the Etaibetsu [\u6075\u5CB1\u5225] River. National 
Route 275 (Sorachi-kokudou or Himawari-road) runs near the town hall.
#3 #4
	National Route 233 (Rumoi-kokudou) passes to the north. The 
Sasshou Line ran until 1972. It was operated by Japanese National 
Railways (``koku-tetsu'').
 	Distinctive industries in Hokuryuu are agriculture and 
sightseeing. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 1,881 hectares in 
2015, buckwheat 585, beans (soybeans 204, adzuki beans 23, other beans 
6), wheat 101, melons 13, fodder 7, watermelons 5, pasture 4,
	(continued) --> flowers 4, tomatoes 2, other vegetables 21+X, 
and other grains 11; dairy cow - (zero) head in 2015.
	The cultivated area of sunflowers (``himawari'') is the largest 
in the country. It covers more than 100 hectares in the whole town and 
23 hectares in Himawari-no-sato Park. Sunflowers are for oil in Western 
countries. They are for landscapes in Japan. (Sunflowers are not listed 
in Census of Agriculture in Japan.) #5

#1  The Uryuu River starts in the Teshio Mountains. The source is 
located at the border between Nakagawa Town and Horokanai Town. The 
length of the Uryuu River is 155 kilometers. It is the second longest 
tributary in the country. The longest tributary is the Sorachi River 
(195 kilometers). Both rivers flow into the Ishikari River.

#2  In 1910 (Meiji 43), Numata Station (now Ishikari Numata Station) on 
the Rumoi Line opened. It was located to the north of Hokuryuu village. 
Residents near the station wanted to relocate the administrative 
office to the north.
	Residents in the south opposed it strongly. After fierce 
debates, the north of the village separated. It became Kami-hokuryuu 
village and later Numata Town. (When the huge aristocratic Uryuu Farm 
was abolished, it was agreed that several village would be established 
in the site. The area that is now Hokuryuu and Numata was included.) 
	The border was set at the Biba-ushi [\u7F8E\u8449\u725B] River 
and the Horo-niitachi-betsu [\u5E4C\u65B0\u592A\u5200\u5225] River (by 
``Hokuryuu-chou-shi [Hokuryuu Town history]'' published in 1969).

#3  The town hall of Hokuryuu is located in Yawara [\u548C] district. 
It means ``harmony'' in Japanese. The district was reclaimed by Baihon-
sha. It was an immigration and development company, and recruited 
immigrants from Chiba Prefecture. It prohibited immigrants from 
drinking alcohol and smoking.
	The company's policy was based on the Houtoku Thought, which 
was advocated by Sontoku Ninomiya (1787-1856). He was an engineer and 
an economist in the Edo era, and refurbished the economy in rural 
areas. He was born in Sagami country (now Kanagawa Prefecture).
	Ninomiya Town in Tochigui Prefecture was named in honor of 
Sontoku Ninomiya. (Generally, the Japanese place names ``Ichi-no-
miya,'' ``Ni-no-miya,'' and ``San-no-miya'' comes from Ichinomiya [1st-
grade] Shrine, Ninomiya [2nd-grade] Shrine, and Sannomya [3rd-grade] 
Shrine.)
	Statues of Sontoku Ninomiya are set in the yards of elementary 
schools. The statue is carrying firewood and reading a book. That is a 
model of hardworking Japanese people.
	I think the essence of Sontoku Ninomiya's Thought (Houtoku-
shisou) is (1) contributing to society and (2) abandoning what you do 
not need. (See Toyokoro Town in Tokachi sub-prefecture and Hokuto City 
in Oshima sub-prefecture for Sontoku Ninomiya's Thought.)
 
#4  Prefectural Route 94 (Mashike-Inada-sen) passes near the town hall 
of Hokuryuu. The road was part of a prisoner road. Prisoners from 
Kabato Prison built it in the Meiji period.
	The prisoner road connected Tsukigata in the Ishikari Plain and 
Mashike on the Sea of Japan side. It was called Teshio Road. (See 
Tsukigata Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for prisoner roads.)

#5   In Hokuryuu Town, the name of the interchange is ``Hokuryuu-
himawari (Hokuryuu sunflower).'' Sunflowers bloom from mid-July to mid-
August. Sunflower Festival is held. The park ``Himawari-no-sato 
(village of sunflower)'' is operated by Hokuryuu Town. It was opened in 
1989.
 	In 1979, Hokuryuu Agricultural Cooperative (now Kita-sorachi 
Agricultural Cooperative) organized a study tour to Europa. The 
participants were moved by a beautiful landscape near Belgrade airport. 
	It was an extensive field of sunflowers. The plane was like a 
butterfly on a flower field. After coming back to Japan, the women's 
division of the agricultural cooperative started to plant sunflowers.
	* * *
	Sunflowers are native to North America. Sunflowers are 
cultivated for making oil. (Japanese people think sunflowers are summer 
garden plants, or something that Major League Baseball players nibble 
on, or food for guinea pigs.)
	When I visited the state of Kansas in the USA, the receptionist 
at a motel recommended that I go to a nearby sunflower field. The 
sunflower field reminded me of the 1970 film Girasoli (Sunflower).

Moseushi [mo-se-u-shi] [\u59B9\u80CC\u725B] is a town in Sorachi sub-
prefecture, central Hokkaidou (``dou-ou''). It is located in the north 
of the Ishikari Plain. The Ishikari River and the Uryuu River flow.
	Moseushi is a small inland town. It is the third smallest 
municipality in Hokkaidou after Kamisunagwa Town and Chippubetsu Town. 
The area is flat, including oxbow lakes (crescent moon lakes).
	The name ``moseushi'' comes from ``mose-us-i'' in Ainu 
language. It means ``Irakusa (hairy nettle), many, place.'' (Although 
the town's name includes the word ``ushi,'' which means ``cow'' in 
Japanese, there are no cows in the area [by Agricultural Census].) #1
 	In 1893 (Meiji 26), Uryuu Farm, a huge noble farm, was 
abolished. Part of the noble farm became Kikutei Farm, which was 
located in what is now Moseushi Town and the west of Fukagawa City. 
(See Uryuu Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for Uryuu Farm; See Shiroishi 
Ward in Sapporo City, Ishikari sub-prefecture, for Yukisue Kikutei, who 
was the owner of Kikutei Farm.)
	In the same year, Guenzou Mori, who was the 2nd principal of 
Sapporo Agricultural College, purchased the uncultivated land of 
Kikutei Farm and started reclamation. The area was included in Fukagawa 
village at the time.
	In 1898 (Meiji 31), Moseushi Station opened on the Governmental 
Hokkaidou Railway (Hokkaidou-kansetsu-tetsudou, now the Hakodate Main 
Line). In 1923 (Taishou 12), Moseushi Village (1st-class municipality) 
was established. It was separated from Fukagawa Town. In 1952 (Shouwa 
27), Moseushi Town was established. (See the note of Nanporo Town for 
1st-class municipality.) #2
	The town hall of Moseushi and the center of the town is located 
in front of Moseush Station on the Hakodate Main Line.
	Distinctive industry in Moseushi is agriculture. Seventy 
percent of the area is cultivated land. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = 
paddy rice 2,387 hectares in 2015, wheat 490, beans (soybeans 89, 
adzuki beans 11), buckwheat 26, flowers 20, onions 5, other vegetables 
10+X, and other grains 5; dairy cow X (concealed) head in 2015. #3
 	As for sports, curling is popular. In the past, women's 
volleyball team at Moseushi Commercial High School was famous.
	 When the volleyball team won the national championship in 
1978, the newspaper reported; ``A town of 6,000 people, minus 25 
degrees in winter, pushed away handicaps.'' In 2009, due to decreases 
in students, the high school closed. #4

#1  As for the name``Irakusa (hairy nettle),'' it is a plant that 
grows on mountains and abandoned farmland. The plant prefers fertile 
soil.
	A curator from Hokkaidou University Museum said, ``There are 
small thorns on the leaf of Irakusa. If you touch the leaf, you feel
pain and irritation, therefore, the name is Ira-kusa. (The grass that 
irritates you. Irritation is ``ira-ira-suru'' in Japanese.)''
	The pain of electric fence is instantaneous. The pain of 
Irakusa continues for a day. The leaf of Irakusa resembles Shiso 
(Lamiaceae herb) and Aoso (ramie).
	Ainu people made clothes from Irakusa. They cut dead and dried 
Irakusa and extracted fibers from the bark. The clothes made from 
Irakusa are displayed in museums and station. They are not available 
for purchase. (See Biratri Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture for Ainu 
culture.)
	* * *
	On the roadside of Tokyo, Aoso (ramie) grows. Another name of 
Aoso is Karamushi. It is in the same family as Irakusa (hairy nettle). 
Japanese people made mosquito nets and clothes from Aoso.
 
#2  According to the ``Moseushi-chou-shi (Moseushi Town history)'' 
published in 1979, the Rumoi Line of the Governmental Ralway 
(Kansetsu-tetsudou) opened in 1910 (Meiji 43). The population of 
Fukagawa Village increased. In 1918 (Taishou 7), Fukagawa Town was 
established.
	The gap between urban and rural areas widened. Rural residents 
opined on the need to divide the municipality. In 1923 (Taishou 12), 
the rural area of Fukagawa Town was separated as Moseushi Village.
 
#3  According to the ``Moseushi-chou-shi (Moseushi Town history)'' 
published in 1979; ``Agriculture suffered from floods, cold weather, 
diseases, and insect pests. Through indescribable hardships, 
agriculture shifted from upland field farming to paddy field farming.
	Land consolidation completed and agriculture shifted from 
horse-powered farming to large-scale mechanized farming. Moseushi 
developed into a rice-producing area that boasts the highest yield per 
land in the prefecture.'' Today, paddy fields spread silently.

#4  According to the ``Moseushi-hyakunen-shi (Moseushii centennial 
history)'' published in 1993; ``Teacher Yoshino moved to Moseushi 
Commercial High School in 1970. At the women's volleyball club, he gave 
practical instructions and built a strong team. Students gathered from 
all over the prefecture.''
	Today, sports is a business. Rich teams gather strong players 
from all over the country. In the case of high school baseball, the 
first team in northern Japan that won the national championship was 
Tomakomai High School of Komazawa University.
	The ace pitcher was from Itami City in western Japan. He later
became a pitcher for New York Yankees. (See Tomakomai City in Iburi 
sub-prefecture and Takikawa City in Sorachi sub-prefecture for sports.)
	Private universities including Komazawa University put money on 
sports. That is a matter of dead or alive for the management. There is 
no place for national universities like Hokkaidou University to compete 
them.
	For example, Hakone relay marathon is an inter-university 
competition. It is broadcast on TV on New Year's Day. High school 
students and their parents watch it. The university that wins the 
marathon attracts a large number of applicants to the entrance 
examination. (Professors at the university get a bonus for checking 
answer sheets.)
	* * *
	I wrote about Brazilian soccer (football) in textbooks; 
``Soccur is popular in Brazil. Even if you live in `favera (slam),' if 
you succeed in soccer, you can be a millionaire. Boys in favera are 
playing soccer.''
	When I visited Brazil, I heard; ``Today, boys who want to be 
professionals need to join club teams. They need money.''

Fukagawa [fu-ka-ga-wa] [\u6DF1\u5DDD] is a city in Sorachi sub-
prefecture, central Hokkaidou (``dou-ou''). The area is located where 
the Ishikari River enters the Ishikari Plain.
	The Ishikari River passes a gorge between the Horonai Mountains 
and the Teshio Mountains and enters the Ishikari Plain. (The Horonai 
Mountains is the northern part of the Yuubari Mountains.) 
	The name ``Fukagawa'' is Japanese. It means ``deep, river.''
It is a translation of ``ooho-nay'' in Ainu language, which means 
``deep, river.'' It signified the Oohou [\u5927\u9CF3] River that flows 
north of the built-up area. The Oohou River is a tributary of the Uryuu 
River. (The Uryuu River is a tributary of the Ishikari River.)
	In 1892 (Meiji 25), Fukagawa village was established. The 
administrative office (``kochou-yakuba'') was jointly operated with the 
administrative office of Uryuu county, which was located in Shin-
totsukawa village. In 1893 (Meiji 26), Uryuu Farm was abolished and 
Kikutei Farm was established. #1
  	In 1895 (Meiji 28) and 1896 (Meiji 29), military settlers' 
colonies (Tonden-heison) were established. They were Minami-ichiyan, 
Kita-iciyan, and Osamunai. Minami-ichiyan was located in the current 
city center. In 1895 (Meij 28), an administrative office was built in 
Fukagawa village. #2 #3
	In 1898 (Meiji 31), Fukagawa Station on the Governmental 
Hokkaidou Railway (now the Hakodate Main Line) opened. In 1899 (Meiji 
32), the administrative office of Otoe [\u97F3\u6C5F] village was 
established. It was separated from Takikawa village. Kikutei Farm was 
abolished and the land was divided into tenant farms.
	In 1902 (Meiji 35), Fukagawa Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established. In 1906 (Meiji 39), Ichiyan [\u4E00\u5DF2] Village 
(2nd-class municipality) was established. (See the note of Nanporo Town 
for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.)
	In 1907 (Meiji 40), Fukagawa Village (1st-class municipality 
was established. In 1910 (Meiji 43), the Rumoi Line opened between 
Fukagawa Station and Rumoi Station. In 1915 (Taishou 4), Tadoshi 
[\u591A\u5EA6 \u5FD7] Village (2nd-class municipality) was established. 
It was separated from Ichiyan Village.
	In 1918 (Taishou 7), Fukagawa Town (1st-class municipality) was 
established. Fukagawa became the center of the northern part of Sorachi 
sub-prefecture. In 1920 (Tashou 9), Osamunai [\u7D0D\u5185] Village 
(2nd-class municipality) was established. It was separated from Ichiyan 
Village.
	In 1962 (Shouwa 37), Tadoshi Town was established. In 1963 
(Shouwa 38), Fukagawa City was established by the merger of Fukagawa 
Town, Ichiyan Village, Osamunai Village, and Otoe Village. In 1970 
(Shouwa 45), Fukagawa City merged Tadoshi Town. 
	The city hall of Fukagawa is located on the right bank (north 
bank) of the Ishikari River. National Route 233 (Fukagawa-kokudu) 
passes. On the left bank (south bank) of the Ishikari River, National 
Route 12 passes. It goes through a gorge of the Ishikari River and 
reaches Asahikawa City. #4
	Fukagawa Station is the junction of the Hakodate Main Line and 
the Rumoi Main Line. In the past, the Shin-mei Line branched off from 
Fukagawa Station. #5
 	Distinctive industries in Fukagawa are agriculture (rice), food 
processing, wood processing, and gravel mining. STATISTICS OF 
AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 5,844 hectares in 2015, buckwheat 2,622, wheat 
510, beans (soybeans 367, adzuki beans 89, other beans 1), pasture 366, 
potatoes 102, orchards 63 (apples 18, grapes 4, other fruits 1+X), 
	(continued) --> fodder 59, flowers 31, sugar beets 12, 
cucumbers 11, melons 8, onions 7, yams 5, tomatoes 2, green onions 1, 
other grains 32, other vegetables 31+X, and other industrial crops 2; 
beef cattle 6,086 head in 2015 and dairy cows 361.
	Paddy fields extend on lowlands along the Ishikari River and 
the Oohou River. Paddy fields have spread since the completion of the 
Taishou Canal in 1916 (Taisou 5) and the Ryuujin Canal in 1927 
(Shouwa 2).
	In upland fields, in the past, Dalmatian chrysanthemums and 
edible lily bulbs were cultivated. Dalmatian chrysanthemum is called 
``jochuu-guiku'' in Japanese. It was used for mosquito coils. (See 
Makkari Village in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for lily bulb.)
	After the enactment of the rice reduction policy (``guentan-
seisaku''), buckwheat increased. The area of cultivated buckwheat is 
the second largest in the country. (The largest is Horokanai Town in 
Kamikawa sub-prefecture.)
	In upland fields, apples, grapes for wine, vegetables, and 
flowers are cultivated. Beef cattle grazing is thriving too. Local 
agricultural products are sold at the roadside station Rice-land 
Fukagawa. #6 #7

#1  The area of Kikutei Farm was 5,756 hectares. It was located in what 
is now Fukagawa City and Moseushi Town. In Fukagawa City, the farm area 
covered Kita-kikusui, Minami-kikusui, and Memu districts. They are near 
the Fukagawa West Interchange of Hokkaidou Expressway [Dou-ou-dou].) 
	The name ``memu'' is Ainu language, which means ``water 
spring.'' (For the  name ``Kikusui,'' see Uryuu Town, Akabira City in 
Sorachi sub-prefecture, and Shiroishi Ward in Sapporo City, Ishikari 
sub-prefecture.)

#2  In the pioneering years, an outbreak of malaria occurred in the 
military settlers' colonies (Tonden-heison) in Fukagawa. It was quartan 
fever malaria (``mikka-netsu'' malaria). Military investigations 
revealed that the cause was Anopheles mosquitoes (``hamadara-ka'') in 
rice paddies.
 	A military settler recalled this (by ``Tonden'' No. 17, 1944); 
``Immigration started and there were diseases. Malaria was prevalent 
for four to five years. Almost all the immigrants here contracted 
malaria.''
	* * *
	I met a geographer who had contracted malaria in Africa. I told 
him about malaria in Fukagawa, Hokkadou. He did not believed it, 
saying; ``There is no malaria in cold regions.'' Actually, malaria 
spread not only in Fukagawa but also in the Tokachi Plains. (See 
Obihiro City in Tokachi sub-prefecture.)
	In the past, Japanese people who immigrated to Brazil settled 
in lowlands to cultivate paddy rice. They contracted malaria. Some 
villages were disappeared for malaria.
	Meanwhile, Western immigrants migrated to high altitude lands 
and ran cattle ranches. The word ``criador'' in Portuguese means 
``ranch owner'' and ``creator'' in English.
	Today, both in Brazil and in Hokkaidou, people do not worry 
about malaria. In Japan, Anopheles mosquitoes (``hamadara-ka'') became 
extinct from rice paddies due to improvements in farming. In the case 
of Brazil, a Brazilian said that people from the USA sprayed 
insecticides after the Second World War.
	The soft drink ``Tonica [T\u00F4nica]'' that includes quinine 
is sold in Brazil. Quinine is used to treat malaria.  
	* * *
	Japanese people do not touch their skin when greeting. They bow 
instead of hugging or shaking hands. The custom may have come from 
memories of infectious diseases and leeches from paddies. Their culture 
is based on warm and humid places.
	Japanese people take off their shoes when entering a house. The 
custom may have come from memories of the mud from paddies. In Tokyo, 
where I live now, roads are covered with bricks, asphalt, and tiles. 
The soles are always clean.
	When I visited a cattle ranch in northern British Columbia, 
Canada, the family took off their shoes when entering the house. I 
told them that was the same as in Japan.

#3  Military settlers (Tonden-hei) in Fukagawa City recall their old 
lives as follows (by ``Tonden'' No. 17, 1944); 
 	(1) ``In the third year after immigration, a typhoid fever 
epidemic broke out. A ward for typhoid patients was build in the 
military settlers' colony. At its peak, there were 50 patients in the 
ward. (There were 400 families in Kita-ichiyan and Minami-ichiyan 
colonies.)
	In the ward, there was a military doctor whose name was Suzuki.
He was an excellent physician. Thanks to him, no one died. He stroked 
the patient's stomach, guessed what the patient had eaten, and pointed 
out that the patient should not have eaten.
	For example, `Did you eat okayu-no-moto (hard boiled rice 
before making okayu [rice grue]?' Or, `Did you eat soup-no-kasu (low 
quality meat for broth)?'''
	(2) ``At the time, rice was scarce. The staple foods were 
adzuki beans, millet (`kibi`), foxtail millet (`awa'), and white 
potatoes (`bareisho'). Some people brought potatoes for lunch during 
military exercises.''
	(3) ``Communication was difficult in family survey. I could not 
understand what the families from Toyama Prefecture were saying, 
especially, the families from Tonami and Gokayama in the prefecture.''
	(About 100 years' ago, when people from Aomori and Kagoshima 
met, they could not understand each other's languages. Even today, when 
I visited Nagasaki, I found it a little hard to hear the taxi driver. 
In my courses, my English may be difficult to hear for foreign 
students.)

#4  To the east of Fukagawa City is a gorge of the Ishikari River. The 
gorge is called Kamui-kotan. The name comes from ``kamuy-kotan'' in 
Ainu language. It means ``god, village.'' (See Asahikawa City in 
Kamikawa sub-prefecture for Kamui-kotan.)
 	In the gorge, there are 13 stone circles (``kanjou-resseki''). 
They have been designated as National Historic Site. They are seen as 
tombs from the Joumon era. It is estimated that the stone circles were 
made about 2,000 years ago.
	In Honshuu island, 2,000 years ago was the Yayoi era (1,000 BC 
to the middle of the 3rd century AD). Yayoi was the era of paddy rice. 
In Hokkaidou, the Joumon era continued. It is also called the Zoku-
joumon era, which means ``the post Joumon era.'' The climate was too 
cold to grow paddy rice. (See Otaru City and Yoichi Town in Shiribeshi 
sub-prefecture for ruins from Zoku-joumon era.)
	* * *
	There was a military settlers' colony (Tonden-heison) near the 
gorge Kamui-kotan. It was Otoe-hei-son. Although cutting down trees was 
hard work, the soil was fertile. The settlers did not use fertilizer.
 
#5  Fukagawa is a traffic node in the northern part of the Ishikari 
Plain. National Route 12 and the Hakodate Main Line run eastward along 
the Ishikari River. These road and railroad run through the Kamui-kotan 
gorge and reach the Kamikawa Basin.
	National Route 233 and the Rumoi Main Line run westward. These 
road and railroad run between the Teshio Mountains and the Mashike 
Mountains, and reach Rumoi City on the Sea of Japan side.
	National Route 275 runs northward, passes Horokanai Town and 
Lake Shumarinai, and reaches the Nayoro Basin. The former Shin-mei Line 
(1924-1995) followed the same route.
  
#6  As the name of roadside station ``Rice-land'' indicates, the local 
specialty is rice. The farm shop in the roadside station sells rice, 
vegetables, and melons. The horticultural crops (vegetables and melons) 
are grown in greenhouses on the hill. The restaurant on the second 
floor of the roadside station is good.

#7  A souvenir from Fukagawa Station is Uroko-dango, which means ``fish 
scale dumplings.'' In the past, freight trains on the Rumoi Main Line 
carried herring and coal. Fish scales (``uroko'' in Japanese) were put 
on freight trains.
	Uroko-dango dumplings are scale-shaped, however, they do not 
contain fish scales. Souvenir shops sell Uroko-dango dumplings at the 
roadside station of Fukagawa, Fukagawa Station, and Sapporo Station.
	Fukagawa-yushi Co. sells potato chips in supermakets and 
souvenier shops in Hokkadou. The potato chips are made from Hokkaidou 
potatoes, fried in domestic rice oil, and seasoned with Okhotsk salt.
The name ``Fukagawa-yushi'' means ``Fukagawa oil.'' The company was 
established in 1940 in Fukagawa Town.

Chippubetsu [chi-ppu-be-tsu] [\u79E9\u7236\u5225] is town in Sorachi 
sub-prefecture, central Hokkaidou (``dou-ou''). The area is located in 
the northern part of the Ishikari Plain. 
	Chippubetsu is the second smallest municipality in the 
prefecture. (The smallest is Kami-sunagwa Town.) The area is flat. 
Paddy fields extend.
	The name ``chippubetsu'' comes from ``ci-kus-pet'' in Ainu 
language. It means ``we, pass, river.'' It signified the Chippubetsu 
River, which is a tributary of the Uryuu River. (The Uryuu River is the 
tributary of the Ishikari River.) Ainu people used boats to travel 
(pass) the Ishikari Plain.
	In 1895 (Meiji 28) and 1896 (Meiji 29), two military settlers' 
colonies (Tonden-heison) were established. One was Higashi-chippu-
heison (East Chippu military settlers' colony) and the other was Nishi-
chippu-heison (West Chippu military settlers' colony).
 	In the two military setters' colonies, 400 families from 24 
prefectures settled. Those were established on the undeveloped land of 
the former Uryuu Farm. (See Uryuu Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for 
Uryuu Farm.) #1
 	In 1901 (Meiji 34), the administrative office (``kochou-
yakuba'') of Chippubetsu village was established. It was separated from 
Fukagawa village. In 1906 (Meiji 39), Chippubetsu Village (2nd-class 
municipality) was established. (See the note of Nanporo Town for 1st-
class and 2nd-class municipalities.)
	In 1923 (Taishou 12), Chippubetsu Village (1st-class 
municipality) was established. In 1959 (Shouwa 34), Chippubetsu Town 
was established.
	The town hall of Chippubetsu is located in front of Chippubetsu 
Station on the Rumoi Main Line. National Route 233 (Fukagawa-kokudou) 
passes. #2
	Distinctive industry in Chippubetsu is paddy rice cultivation. 
STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 2,122 hectares in 2015, 
buckwheat 269, wheat 191, soybeans 68, broccoli 34, pasture 4, flowers 
3, tomatoes 1, other grains 18, and other vegetables X (concealed); 
dairy cow - (zero) head in 2015.
 	JA (Japan Agricultural Cooperatives) Kita-ibuki sells high-
quality rice. The rice varieties are Yume-pirka, Nanatsu-boshi, and 
Kirara 397. Chippubetsu is one of the rice seed (``tane-momi'') 
producing areas in Hokkaidou. (See Uryuu Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture 
for paddy rice.) #3 #4
	As for sightseeing, Chippubetsu Hot Spring is located near 
Chippubetsu Station. A tower stands on the hot spring grounds. It was 
built to commemorate the centennial anniversary of the town. There is a 
bell at the top of the tower. It commemorates the bell that told the 
time in the military settlers' colonies.

#1  Military settlers (Tonden-hei) recall their old lives as follows 
(by ``Chippubetsu-chou-shi [Chippubetsu Town history]'' published in 
1964); 
	(1) ``In 1896 (Meiji 29), I came from Hiroshima. In 1902 (Meiji 
35), there was no harvest from paddy fields, because of plant-hopper 
(``unka'' in Japanese) damage. In the spring of 1903 (Meiji 36), we ate 
bamboo grass seeds.''
	(In the past, Japanese people said ``nari-doshi-wa-fusaku [the 
year when bamboo-grass bears fruit will be a crop failure]'' by Nihei 
lab 2023b.)
	(2) ``What I thought was horse manure was bear droppings. I 
heard `Woooo, Woooo,' a terrifying, earth-shattering roar of a bear. 
When I went outside, I hit a tin can. In a year, the bear ate 3-tan (30 
ares) of toukibi (corn). The bear ate it completely.''
	(3) ``I was a samurai (``shi-zoku'') and was a complete novice 
in agriculture. My grandfather fell ill two months after settling here. 
He died two months after becoming ill. I was the head of the household 
and had to go to military training every day. My wife did most of the 
clearing work alone.''
	(4) ``I was a child of Tonden-hei (military settler) family. 
When I became independent and had a house along Ichijou-douri (1-jou 
street), I was given `itto' (1-to) of rice as a celebration. (`Itto' is 
15 kg in the case of rice.) I consumed the `itto' of rice for one year.
	The staple foods were `ina-kibi' (glutinous proso millet), 
wheat, and barley. If someone bought `ippyou' (1-hyou, 60 kg) of rice, 
everybody's eyes widened.
	In the military settlers' colony, the rice allowance for a 
family was limited to five people, therefore, the life of a large 
family was difficult. When they got the harvest of `gosho-imo' (white 
potatoes) in autumn, they relieved.'' (See Shihoro Town in Tokachi 
sub-prefecture for gosho-imo.)
	(5) ``I was a child of Tonden-hei (militry settler) family. I 
was often sent on errands to other families. It was tough, because I 
could not understand their languages. The families came from all over 
the country, including Shikoku, Ouu, Hokuriku, and Kyuushuu regions. 
(See Fukagawa City in Sorachi sub-prefecture for dialect.) 
	Roads were bad. The land was a swamp. Water seeped onto the 
roads. Weeds and bamboo grass grew densely. The branches of tall trees 
were so intertwined that I could not see the sky even if I looked up. 
It was home to many kinds of animals.
	Nowadays, if I call loudly, neighbors can hear me. Or, I can 
put on my sandals and can run to the neighbors.''
	(6) ``The head of the household went off to military training 
every day. Development was the duty of other family members. First, we 
cut down trees and mowed the grass around the house. Then, we collected 
the trees and grass and burned them. The flames rose high into the sky. 
The flames continued for a month.
	The size of trees were 3-shaku (90 centimeters) and 4-shaku 
(120 centimeters) in diameter. Looking back now, it was regrettable 
that we wasted those large trees. Tree stumps remained in upland fields 
and paddy fields for a long time. They hindered horse-drawn plowing.''
	(7) ``Many deer lived. When I went outside the house, I found 
many deer antlers scattered in the grass. I picked them up and used 
them as hooks of the hearth (`irori') and as clothes hangers.
	The trees around the house had many nests belonging to finches 
(`mashiko'), cuckoos, owls, and other birds. Even the adult birds could 
be caught with our hands. Collecting nests and eggs was a job for the 
children when they came home from school.
	We also caught fish. There was a lot of `ugoi (ugui, big-scaled 
redfin, dace [deisu] fish).' At the time, `ugoi' were from 1-shaku (30 
centimeters) to 2-shaku (60 centimeters). No one paid any attention to 
the tiny ``funa'' (crucian carp) that are common nowadays.''
 
#2  The town hall of Chippubetsu is located near the former site of the 
head office of Higashi-chippu-heison (East Chippu military settlers' 
colony). The colony was``chuu-tai,'' which means a company within 
a military unit.
	The Fukagawa-Rumoi Expressway passes Chippubetsu Town. It takes 
35 minutes from Chippbetsu Interchange to Asahikawa-Takasu 
Interchange, and 1 hour and 20 minutes to Sapporo-kita Interchange.
	It is permitted to install food waste disposals in residential 
buildings to reduce food waste. (When I was a child, I saw a food waste 
disposal in an American horror movie and thought it was horrible.)
   
#3  JA Kita-ibuki was established in 2003 by the merger of Chippubetsu 
Agricultural Cooperative, Moseushi Agricultural Cooperative, and Numata
Town Agricultural Cooperative. In Honshuu island, in the past, 
agricultural cooperatives were considered as good working places in the 
countryside as well as town halls and village halls.

#4  These are rice seed producing areas in Hokkaidou; (1) Hokuto City 
in Oshima sub-prefecture, (2) Toubetsu Town in Ishikari sub-prefecture, 
(3) the former Kurisawa Town in Iwamizawa City, (4) the former Ebeotsu 
Town in Takikawa City, (5) Chippubetsu Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture, 
(6) and Nakafurano Town in Kamikawa sub-prefecture.
	Hokuren Rice Seed Center is located in Takikawa City. (Hokuren 
is the Hokkaidou Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives.) Genetic 
Resources Division of Hokkaidou Agricultural Experiment Station is also 
located in Takikawa City. (See Naganua Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture

Numata [nu-ma-ta] [\u6CBC\u7530] is a town in Sorachi sub-prefecture, 
central Hokkaidou. It is an inland town. The area is located from the 
northern end of the Ishikari Plain to the Mashike Mountains. The Uryuu 
River and its tributary, the Horo-nii-tachi-betsu River [\u5E4C\u65B0
\u592A\u5200\u5225], flow.
  	The name ``Numata'' is Japanese. It comes from the sir name of 
Kisaburou Numata. He established Honganji Farm in what is now Numata 
Town. He was a wealthy merchant in Otaru. (Wealthy merchant is called 
``gou-shou'' in Japanese.) #1
	In 1914 (Taishou 3), the administrative office (``kochou-
yakuba'') of Kami-hokuryuu [\u4E0A\u5317\u7ADC] was established. It was 
separated from Hokuryuu village. In 1918 (Taishou 7), Horokanai village 
was separated from Kami-hokuryuu village.
	In 1919 (Taishou 8), Kami-hokuryuu Village (2nd-class 
municipality) was established. In 1922 (Taishou 11), Numata Village was 
established (Kami-hokuryuu was renamed). (See the note of Nanporo Town 
for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.) 
	In 1939 (Shouwa 14), Numata Village (1st-class municipality) 
was established. In 1947 (Shouwa 22), Numata Town was established.
	The town hall of Numata is located near the Uryuu River. The 
Rumoi Main Line and National Route 275 (Sorachi-kokudou) pass. In the 
past, Numata Station was a junction between the Rumoi Main Line and the 
Sasshou Line.
	In the past, Ebishima Station was a junction between the Rumoi 
Main Line and the Rumoi Railway. The Rumoi Railway ran along the Horo-
nii-tachi-betsu River and connected coal mines of Asano, Shouwa, and 
Tachibetsu. They were called Rumoi Coal Field (Rumoi-tanden) or Uryuu 
Coal Field (Uryuu-tanden).
	Between the 1930s and the 1960s, Numata flourished from coal 
mines. In 1969 (Shouwa 44), the last coal mine was closed. In 1971 
(Shouwa 46), the Rumoi Railway was abolished. In 1972 (Shouwa 47), the 
section of the Sasshou Line, between Shin-totsukawa and Numata, was 
abolished.
	After coal mines were closed, the Japan Ground Self-defense 
Force was invited. (See Yuubari City in Sorachi sub-prefecture for coal 
mining.)
	Distinctive industries in Numata are paddy rice cultivation and 
sightseeing. STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE = paddy rice 2,374 hectares, 
buckwheat 641, beans (soybeans 220, adzuki beans 50), wheat 206, 
	(continued) --> sugar beets 34, pasture 33, flowers 7, tomatoes 
6, fodder 4, melons 2, orchards 1, other grains 1, other vegetables X 
(concealed); dairy cows X head in 2015.
	As for sightseeing, Ebishima Station was used as a filming 
location for the NHK drama ``Suzuran (lily of the valley).'' (NHK is 
Japan Broadcasting Corporation.) Filming sets such as a wooden station 
building and a station-master's house remain.
	Hotaru-no-sato (Village of Firefly) is located along the Horo-
nii-tachi-betsu River. Fireflys fly from late June to early August.
	Village of Firefly includes Horoshin Hot Spring, the Numata 
Fossil Museum, an auto camping site, and a lifelong learning center. 
Those are managed by Numata Town. Fossil cleaning experiences at the 
Numata Fossil Museum are popular with elementary school children. #2
 
#1  Kisaburou Numata (1834-1923) was a farmer in Toyama Prefecture. At 
the age of 49, he left his wife and children behind and moved to Otaru, 
Hokkaidou.
	He put waterwheels on the Myouken River and started rice 
milling business. (The Myouken [\u5999\u898B] River is the downstream 
of Okobachi [\u65BC\u53E4\u767A] River. It flows into the Otaru Canal.)
	In 1891 (Meiji 24), he founded Kyousei, a limited partnership 
company. He added waterwheels to the Katsunai River and to the Asari 
River. (The Katsunai River flows east from the Myouken River. The 
Katsunai River flows into the Central Pier of Otaru. The Asari River 
flows east from the Myouken River. The area was Asari Village.)
	* * * 
	Kisaburou Numata opened a branch company in Sapporo. The 
wealthy merchants (``gou-shou'') of Otaru were called ``Kome-no-Numata 
(Numata of Rice)'' and ``Mame-no-Takahashi (Takahashi of Beans).'' 
Takahashi was Naoji Takahashi (1856-1926), who exported beans from 
Hokkaidou to Europe.
	Kisaburou Numata predicted, ``As rice cultivation is spreading 
in Hokkaidou, the rice milling business, which is based on imported 
rice from Honshuu island, will dwindle.''
	He planed to start rice cultivation in Hokkaidou. In 1893 
(Meiji 26), the huge Uryuu Farm in the northern Ishikari Plain was 
abolished. (See Uryuu Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture for Uryuu Farm.)
	Numata negotiated with Count Kouei Ootani of Higashi Honganji 
Temple, who was one of the investors of Uryuu Farm. He leased over 10 
million-tsubo (3,300 hectares) of land, and opened Honganji Farm at the 
former site of Uryuu Farm.
	Numata recruited immigrants from Tonami region in Toyama 
Prefecture, which was his hometown. In 1894 (Meiji 27), immigration 
started.
	In 1912 (Meiji 45), the head office of Kyousei was constructed 
in Otaru Ward (now Otaru City). It was a brick building with a copper 
roof. It is now Otaru Music Box Hall (Otaru-orugooru-kan). (A Music box 
is called ``orgel'' in Nederlands.)

#2  In geology, Numata Town is known for the fossils of Takahashi-
hotate, which are large scallops that lived 5 million years ago. (They 
became extinct.)
	 At the Numata Fossil Museum, visitors can try cleaning 
fossils. The fossils are small ammonites and shark teeth imported from 
Morocco. Visitors can take them home after cleaning.
	Numata Fossil Museum opened in 2000. In May 2015, my son, 
Masaki Nihei, became the 15,000th visitor. In the lifelong learning 
center of Numata Town, a large totem pole is displayed. It is a gift 
from the sister city, Port Hardy.
	Port Hardy is located in the north of Vancouver Island, Canada. 
Numata Town and Port Hardy became sister cities through the mediation 
of the president of a fish processing factory in Numata Town. 
	Another sister city is Oyabe City in Tonami region, Toyama 
Prefecture. The Yotaka-andon Festival is held in Numata Town in August. 
In the festival, large lamp floats collide with each other. The 
festival originated in Oyabe City.
