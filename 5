                               Introduction

   When I worked for Hokkaidou University (Faculty of Letters, 2010-2021), I 
guided many field excursions. This article is written based on my excursion 
notes. (by T. Nihei) #1
   In this article, place names are written as they are pronounced, for 
example, Hokkaido --> Hokkaidou. This is because Japanese place names are 
sometimes difficult to pronounce (Nihei lab 2024a).

   #1 As for field excursion, it is good for education. I still remember 
vividly teachers words I hear during field excursions 30 years ago. Words 
goes into the brain by the wind. Bus excursion is not always good because 
some students fall asleep.

   Oshima [o-shi-ma] [\u6E21\u5CF6] is a sub-prefecture (Sougou-shinkou-kyoku) 
in south Hokkaidou (Dou-nan). It is located in the south and the east of the 
Oshima Peninsula. It faces Uchiura Bay (Volcano Bay), Tsugaru Strait, and the 
Sea of Japan. #1
   Compared to other areas in Hokkaidou, the temperature of Oshima is high and 
snowfall is low. By Koeppen's climate classification, the coast of Matsumae 
Town in Oshima sub-prefecture is classified as Cfa (humid subtropical), whereas 
most areas of Hokkaidou is classified as Dfb (humid continental, cool summer). 
   In the case of Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture, the mean annual 
temperature is 9.1 C (average from 1981 to 2010), the mean annual precipitation 
is 1152 mm, and the mean annual snowfall is 381 cm. #2
   The name Oshima is Japanese. The pronunciation of the Kanji characters 
Watari-shima [\u6E21\u5CF6] changed to Oshima. The meaning is ``across, 
island.''
   In the mid 15th century, forts (Tate) were established by the Japanese. In 
the Edo era (17th to 19th centuries), this area was ruled by the Matsumae 
Domain and sometimes by the Tokugawa Shogunate. (See Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama 
sub-prefecture for the forts; See Matsumae Town and Hakodate City in Oshima 
sub-prefecture for the history of the Edo era). 
   After the Meiji period, in 1869 (Meiji 2), Oshima country (Oshima-no-kuni
[\u6E21\u5CF6\u56FD]) was established. The Hokkaidou Development Commission 
(Kaitaku-shi) was established in Hakodate. In 1871 (Meiji 4), the Hokkaidou 
Development Commission moved to Sapporo, and Hakodate's building became a 
branch. In 1879 (Meiji 12), administrative offices for counties (Gun-yakusho 
[\u90E1\u5F79\u6240]) were established, and administrative offices (kochou-
yakuba) for villages and towns were established. (Cf. administrative offices 
(kochou-yakuba) establihed before this year were a continuation of village and 
town chiefs from the Edo era).
   In 1882 (Meiji 15), the Hokkaidou Development Commission was abolished, and 
prefectures of Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro were established. In 1886 (Meiji 
19), the three prefectures were abolished, and Hokkaidou Prefecture Office 
(Hokkaidou-chou) was established. In 1897 (Meiji 30), administrative offices
for counties were abolished, and sub-prefectures of Hakodate, Kameda, and 
Matsumae were established in the area of today's Oshima sub-prefecture. In 1899 
(Meiji 32), Hakodate sub-prefecture merged Kameda sub-prefecture. In 1903 
(Meiji 36), Hakodate sub-prefecture merged Matsumae sub-prefecture. As this, 
Meiji was a turbulent period.
   In 1922 (Taishou 11), Hakodate sub-prefecture was renamed Oshima sub-
prefecture. In 2010, Oshima General Sub-prefectural Bureau (Oshima-sougou-
shinkou-kyoku) was established.
   These are municipalities in Oshima; Hakodate (279,127 people in 2010, 3rd 
largest in Hokkaidou), Hokuto (48,032), Nanae (28,453), Yakumo (18,896), Mori 
(17,859), Matsumae (8748), Oshamambe (6386), Kikonai (5386), Fukushima (5114), 
Shiriuchi (5074), and Shikabe (4767). The sub-prefectural bureau is located in 
Hakodate.

   #1 Volcano Bay is called Funka-wan in Japanese. It was named by William 
Robert Broughton, a British naval officer, in 1796. At the time, volcanoes 
erupted around the bay.
   The shape of the bay looks like a caldera (volcano), but there is no caldera 
as large as this size in the country (the largest one is Kussharo Caldera in 
Teshikaga Town in Kushiro sub-prefecture).
   #2 As for climate, in the case of Tokyo (Chiyoda Ward; representative data 
of Japan), the mean annual temperature is 15.4 C (average from 1981 to 2010) 
and the mean annual rainfall is 1529 mm. The climate of Tokyo is classified as 
Cfa (humid subtropical) by Koeppen's climate classification.
   For the coldest month, the mean temperature in Tokyo is 5.2 C in January. 
The mean temperature in Hakodate is -2.6 C in January. For the hottest month, 
the mean temperature in Tokyo is 26.4 C in August. The mean temperature in 
Hakodate is 22.0 C in August.

                             -------------------
   Hiyama [hi-ya-ma] [\u6A9C\u5C71] is a sub-prefecture (Shinkou-kyoku) in 
south Hokkaidou (Dou-nan). The area is located in the west of the Oshima 
Peninsula. It faces the Sea of Japan. The area is divided into north and south. 
#1
   The climate of Hiyama is relatively mild compared to other areas in 
Hokkaidou, because it is located in the south of the island and is influenced 
by the warm Tsushima Current. It is windy in winter due to the monsoon blowing 
from the continent.
   According to Koeppen's climate classification, most areas in Hiyama is 
classified as Dfb (humid continental, cool summer), however, coasts of Esashi 
Town and Okushiri island are classified as Cfa (humid subtropical) and other 
coasts are classified as Cfb (temperate oceanic). The population is distributed 
along the coast. In the case of Esashi Town, the mean annual temperature is 
10.1 C (average from 1981 to 2010), the mean annual precipitation is 1197 mm, 
and the mean snowfall is 330 cm. #2
   The name Hiyama is Japanese. ``Hi-yama'' means ``cypress [ˈsai-pres], 
mountain.'' It was suggested by Takeshirou Matsuura in the beginning of the 
Meiji period, because a lot of Hiba (a kind of cypress) grew in the area 
(Takeshirou Matsuura was an explorer of Hokkaidou). After the late 17th 
century, during the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain felled and sold the cypress 
trees in today's Hiyama sub-prefecture. #3 #4
   The history of Japanese immigration to Hiyama is long. In the mid 15th 
century, the Andou clan built 12 forts in today's Hiayama and Oshima sub-
prefectures. In the Edo era, the southern part of today's Hiyama sub-
prefecture was ruled by the Matsumae Domain and at one time by the Tokugawa 
Shogunate. #5
   After the Meiji period, in 1869 (Meiji 2), the area was included in Oshima-
no-kuni (Oshima country [\u6E21\u5CF6\u56FD]) and Shiribeshi-no-kuni 
(Shiribeshi country [\u5F8C\u5FD7\u56FD]). In 1872 (Meiji 5), Esashi office of 
the Hokkaidou Development Commission was built. In 1897 (Meiji 30), Hiyama sub-
prefecture (Hiyama-shichou [\u6A9C\u5C71\u652F\u5E81] was established. It was 
separated from Oshima and Shiribeshi countries. In 2010, Hiyama Sub-prefectural 
Bureau (Hiyama-shinkou-kyoku) was established.
   These are municipalities in Hiyama; Setana (9590 people in 2010), Esashi 
(9004), Imakane (6186), Kaminokuni (5428), Assabu (4409), Otobe (4408), and 
Okushiri (3033). The sub-prefecture bureau is located in Esashi.
   The poplation of Hiyama is the smallest of the sub-prefectures. All 
municipalities in Hiyama are designated as depopulated areas (Kaso-chiiki). 

   #1 As for the shape of Hiyama sub-prefecture, which is devided into two 
parts, there used to be Kumaishi Town in the middle. Kumaishi was merged to 
Yakumo Town in Oshima sub-prefecture at Pacific Ocean side.
   #2 As for climate, in the case of Tokyo (Chiyoda Ward; representative data 
of Japan), the mean annual temperature is 15.4 C (average from 1981 to 2010) 
and the mean annual rainfall is 1529 mm. The climate of Tokyo is classified as 
Cfa (humid subtropical).
   For the coldest month, the mean temperature in Tokyo is 5.2 C in January. 
The mean temperature in Esashi is -0.8 C in January. For the hottest month, 
the mean temperature in Tokyo is 26.4 C in August. The mean temperature in 
Esashi is 22.6 C in August.
   #3 As for the name Hiyama, Takeshirou Matsuura, an explorer of Ezo (old 
Hokkaidou), suggested place names for Ezo island by his book ``Ezochi-gunmei-
no-gi-torishirabe-sho (Ezo region county name survey report) 
[\u8766\u5937\u5730\u90E1\u540D\u4E4B\u5100\u53D6\u8ABF\u66F8].'' The book was 
submitted to the Meiji government in 1869 (Meiji 2) and government officials 
decided the place names. Hiyama was one of them.
   Before the Edo era, in the 15th century, the Andou clan migrated to Ezo and 
built 15 forts. The Andou clan returned to the main land (today's Honshuu 
island) and built Hiyama Castle (in today's Akita Prefecture) (See Kaminokuni 
Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the 15 forts).
   Takeshirou Matsuura may have taken the name of the old castle of the Andou 
clan.
   #4 As for the name Hiyama (cypress mountain), cypress trees in south 
Hokkaidou and Aomori prefectures are called Hinoki-asunaro or Hiba, whereas cypr
ess trees in Japan usually means Hinoki. For example, Houryuuji Temple, the 
oldest wooden building in the country, which was rebuilt in 670, is made of 
Hinoki. Carpenters considered Hinoki to be the best wood. (See Kaminokuni Town 
in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the oldest building in Hokkaidou.)
   The name Hinoki-asunaro means ``tomorrow, I will be Hinoki'' in Japanese. 
This means the wood of Hinoki-asunaro is inferior to Hinoki, however, actually, 
Hinoki-asunaro also provides good wood.
   The leaves of Hinoki-asunaro are denser than Hinoki. Hinoki-asunaro grows 
slower than Hinoki, Sugi (ceder), and Todo-matsu (Hokkaidou's fir). It grows 
even on shady north slopes and moist soils along the sea. It grows slowy and 
steadily.
   The wood of Hinoki-asunaro has a tight grain (less likely to warp) and is 
resistant to moisture (less likely to rot). It was used for pillars, bathtubs, 
boats, bridges, and cutting boards.
   The natural forests of cypress (Hinoki-asunaro) in Hiyama sub-prefecture 
were said ``very good trees from the coast,'' however, most of them were lost 
for felling and fires in the Edo era. Today, two natural forests are preserved 
in the remote mountains. They have been designated as National Natural 
Monuments. (See Assabu and Esashi towns for the cypress felling.)
   #5 As for the history of Hiyama sub-prefecture, a high school teacher said; 
``Hiyama's culture is different from other parts of Hokkaidou. You can see 
it at festivals.''

   Matsumae [ma-tsu-ma-e] [\u677E\u524D] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, 
south Hokkaidou (Dou-nan). The area is located in the southwest of the Oshima 
Peninsula. The part of the peninsula is called Matsumae Peninsula.
   Matsumae is the southernmost municipality in Hokkaidou. The area faces the 
Tsugaru Strait and the Sea of Japan. It includes islands of Ooshima and Kojima 
on the Sea of Japan. #1 #2
   The area is mountainous. Forests occupy 87% of the area. Rivers are short. 
Mt. Daisengen (1072 m) stands to the north. In the past, there was a large gold 
mine Mt. Daisengen. (See Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the gold 
miners in the mountain).
   The climate along the coast is humid subtropical (``Cfa'' by Koeppen's 
climate classification. Camellia and Mousou bamboo (a kind of large bamboo) 
grow in Matsumae. (Cf. almost all other parts of Hokkaidou are classified as 
Dfb = humid continental, cool summer). 
   The name Matsumae was derived from the Ainu word mat-oma-i (woman, live, 
place). It signify the uniqueness of the place in which Japanese women live. In 
Ezo (old Hokkaidou), most Japanese people returned to their homelands in 
winter. ``Matsumae'' signified the territory of the Japanese. They could have 
children in the place.
   As for history, in 720, the place name Watari-shima-tsugaru-tsu 
[\u6E21\u5CF6\u6D25\u8EFD\u6D25] was recorded. It meant a port (tsu [\u6D25]) 
between Watari-shima (now Hokkaidou Prefecture) and Tsugaru (now Aomori 
Prefecture). It was today's Port of Matsumae. In the 14th century, the place 
name Matoumainu [\u4E07\u5802\u5B87\u6E80\u4F0A\u72AC] was recorded. From the 
13th to 15th centuries, the Andou clan from Tsugaru traded with the Ainu. In 
1457, Koshamain's War happened. Koshamain was a chief of the Ainu. In the war, 
the Ainu forces destroyed 10 out of 12 forts, which were built by the Andou 
clan in what is now south Hokkaidou. (See Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-
prefecture for the old forts). #3
   During the Edo era, Matsumae was the capital of the Matsumae Domain. It was 
the northernmost castle town in Japan. The domain managed the ports of 
Matsumae, Esashi, and Hakodate, which were gateways to Ezo (old Hokkaidou). 
``Matsmai'' in Moby Dick (a novel) refers to Hokkaidou.
   In the end of the Edo era, in 1868, during the Boshin War, the Matsumae 
Domain separated the Tokugawa Shogunate and supported the new Meiji government. 
In the beginning of the Meiji period, during the Boshin War, the former 
Tokugawa Shogunate forces landed Ezo and took Fukuyama Castle (Matsumae 
Castle). In 1869 (Meiji 2), the Meiji government forces recaptured Fukuyama 
Castle and advanced to Hakodate, where the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces 
stayed, and brought the war to an end. 
   After the Boshin war, the Matsumae Domain was renamed the Tate Domain. It 
was named after Tate Castle in Assabu. (See Hakodate City in Oshima sub-
prefecture for Boshin War; See Assabu Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for Tate 
Castle). In 1871 (Meiji 4), the Tate Domain was abolished and Aomori Prefecture 
governed the south part of Hokkaidou. In 1872 (Meiji 5), Matsumae office of 
the Hokkaidoou Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi) was established. In 1881 
(Meiji 14), an administrative office of Matsumae county (Matsumae gun-yakusho) 
was established, and Matsumae office of the Hokkaidou Development Commission 
was abolished. In 1897 (Meiji 30), Matsumae sub-prefecture was established, and 
the administrative office of Matsumae county was abolished.
   In 1900 (Meiji 33), Fukuyama [\u798F\u5C71] Town (1st-class municipality) 
was established. At that time, 34 towns in the built-up area, which were 
continued from the Edo era, were merged. In 1903 (Meiji 36), Matsumae sub-
prefecture were merged by Hakodate sub-prefecture. #4
   In 1915 (Taishou 4), Ooshima [\u5927\u5CF6] Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established by the merger of three villages; Eramachi [\u6C5F\u826F\u753A], 
Haraguchi [\u539F\u53E3], and Kiyobe [\u6E05\u90E8]. Ooshima village was not in 
Ooshima island.
   In 1923 (Taishou 12), Kojima [\u5C0F\u5CF6] Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established by the merger of five villages; Nebuta [\u6839\u90E8\u7530], 
Akagami [\u8D64\u795E], Satsumae [\u672D\u524D], Mogusa [\u8302\u8349], and 
Utari [\u96E8\u5782]. Kojima village was not in Kojima island. In the same 
year, Oosawa [\u5927\u6CA2] Village (2nd-class municipality) was established by 
the merger of four villages; Oosawa, Araya [\u8352\u8C37], Sumiyakizawa [\u70AD\
U713C\u6CA2], and Kamioyobe [\u4E0A\u53CA\u90E8]. #5
   In 1940 (Shouwa 15), the name Fukuyama Town was changed to Matsumae Town. In 
1954 (Shouwa 29), Matsumae Town merged the villages of Ooshima, Kojima, and 
Oosawa.
   Matsume's town hall and Matsumae Castle (formerly called Fukuyama Castle) 
are located near the mouth of the Oomatsumae River. National Route 228 
(Fukuyama-kaidou or Matsumae-kokudou) passes there. ``Fukuyama-kaidou'' was the 
trail that connected Matsumae and Hakodate in the Edo era. (See Fukushima Town 
in Oshima sub-prefecture for Fukuyama-kaidou). In the past, Matsumae Station 
was the terminal of the Matsumae Line. The railroad connected Matsumae and 
Kikonai. The population peaked at 20,072 in 1955. #6 #7
   Distinctive industries of Matsumae are fishery, food processing (mainly 
Surume and Matsumae-zuke), and sightseeing. FARMING; fodder 192 hectares in 
2015, pasture 154, paddy rice X (concealed); and dairy cows - (zero). FISHERY; 
squid (flying squid 540 tons in 2017, other squid 154), snow crabs 442, atka 
mackerel 334, sea urchins 126, tuna 92, Pacific cod 61, Konbu kelp (cultured) 
57, octopus 49, sharks 47, olive flounder 6, shrimp/prawns 5, walleye pollock 
4, abalone (cultured) 2, yellowtail 1, herring -, other fish 29+X, and other 
marine animals 11. #8
   As for sightseeing, Matsumae Castle is famous for cherry blossoms. There is 
a botanical garden with 10,000 cherry trees of 250 varieties. Also, there are 
many temples, because Matsumae was a castle town. Tourists can enjoy seeing the 
architecture and gardens of the temples. In the past, monks were like today's 
civil servants because they could read and write, so there are many temples in 
castle towns. #9

   #1 The southernmost point of Hokkaidou island is Cape Shirakami along 
National Route 228 (41[\u00B0] 23.87' North, 140[\u00B0] 11.86' East). When 
small islands are included, the southernmost point is Kojima island. It is also 
called Matsumae-kojima island or Oshima-kojima island. It is an uninhabited 
island.
   Ooshima island is the largest uninhabited island (9.7 km2) in the country. 
It is also called Matsumae-ooshima island or Oshima-ooshima island. The island 
is a volcano and erupted in 1741. The eruption caused tidal waves that killed 
1467 people in the Matsumae Domain (which ruled what is now south part of 
Hokkaidou) and 566 people in the Tsugaru Domain (which ruled what is now west 
of Aomori Prefecture).
  Today, tourists are not allowed to land Ooshima and Kojima islands. There are 
shelters for fishing boats in the islands. The islands are breeding grounds of 
seabirds such as Umigarasu (murre) and Oomizunagi-dori (Ostreaked shearwater). 
   #2 As for the Tsugaru Strait, the distance between Cape Shirakami in 
Matsumae Town and Cape Tappizaki in Sotogahama Town (Aomori Prefecture) is 19.5 
km. The distance between Cape Shiokubi in the former Toi Town (now Hakodate 
City) and Cape Ooma in Ooma Town (Aomori Prefecture) is 19.0 km. In the west 
(Matsumae and Sotogahama), the water is longer but shallower so that the 
undersea tunnel Seikan Tunnel was constructed in the west. (See the note of 
Hakaodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the Tsugaru Strait).  
   #3 As for Koshamain's War in 1457, the warlord Nobuhiro Takeda who was a 
vassal of the Andou clan ended the war. (See Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-
prefecture for Nobuhiro Takeda). 
   His great-grandson, Suehiro Kakizaki, made peace with Ainu chiefs around 
1549. Yoshihiro Kakizaki, who was the son of Suehiro Kakizaki, became 
independent from the Andou clan in 1593. He was able to ask Hideyoshi Toyotomi, 
the ruler of Japan, for the land of Ezo (now Hokkaidou). The meeting was 
arranged by the Maeda clan, the ruler of the Kaga Domain, today's Ishikawa 
Prefecture.
   In 1599, after the death of Hideyoshi Toyotomi, Yoshihiro Kakizaki gave the 
map of Ezo to Ieyasu Tokugawa, who was the founder of the Tokugawa Shogunate. 
Maps were very important information for ruling the land during the Warring 
States era. Giving the map meant obedience.
   In 1604, in the Edo era, the Tokugawa Shogunate appointed Yoshihiro Kakizaki 
as the lord of the Matsumae Domain, and he changed his family name from 
Kakizaki to Matsumae. So, there is a legend that the place name Matsumae is 
related to Matsudaira (Tokugawa's family name) and Maeda.
   #4 As for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities, in Hokkaidou, 1st-class 
(ikkyuu) and 2nd-class (nikyuu) municipalities were designated from 1899 to 
1943. The Hokkaidou government subsidized 2nd-class municipalities. It was a 
pioneering period.
   #5 As for the former Sumiyakizawa village in Matsumae Town, a novelist Sei 
Itou was born in Sumiyakizawa village. The name Sumi-yaki-zawa means 
``charcoal, burn, stream'' in Japanese.
   Sei Itou's novels were influenced by James Joyce. He was one of the 
translators of James Joyce's Ulysses, which was published in Japan from 1931 to 
1933. (See the note of Otaru City in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for Sei Itou.)
   James Joyce was an Irish who published his novels in English (not Celtic) 
and died in Zurich.
   #6 As for Fukuyama Castle, which is called Matsumae Castle today, it was 
designated as a national treasure of Japan, but it was burned down in 1949. 
   The only national treasure in Hokkaidou now is a clay figurine that was dug 
out of a potato field. (See the note of Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture 
for the national treasure.)
   #7 Matsumae Town is a sister city with Oumi-hachiman City in Shiga 
Prefecture and Yanagawa Town (now Date City) in Fukushima Prefecture. The 
reasons date back to the Edo era. Merchants from Oumi-hachiman, who were called 
Hachiman-shounin, traded in Ezo using northern-bound ship (Kitamae-bune). They 
based in Matsumae castle town and developed herring fishing grounds. 
   Regarding the relationship between Matsumae and Yanagawa, the Tokugawa 
Shogunate directly ruled Ezo in 1807 to prevent Russian movement to the south. 
The Matsumae Domain's vassals were forced to moved to Yanagawa, because the
domain's behavior to the Russian movement was judged bad. Half of the vassals 
became rounin (jobless samurai) and lived in hardship for 14 years until the 
Matsumae Domain was returned to Ezo in 1821.
   #8 As for food processing industry in Matsumae, ``surume'' is famous. Surume 
is dried flying squid. Matsumae and neighboring Fukushima are the largest 
producers of dried flying squid in the country. Their tonnages account for 80% 
of the national share.
   In the late Meiji period (about 100 years ago), herring fishing decreased 
and flying squid fishing prospered. Flying squid were processed into dried 
flying squid (surume). Flying squid were processed by fishers in the past, but 
according to the increase in catches, local companies started processing after 
the 1970s (by Matsumae Town's website ``History of Matsumae Surume,'' last 
accessed May 2019).
   Matsumae-zuke is pickles made with Konbu kelp, dried flying squid, and 
herring roe. A variety of Matsumae-zuke are sold at the souvenir shop ``Dosanko 
Plaza'' in Sapporo Station. In the past, when herring catches were poor, 
Matsumae-zuke without herring roe was sold.
   #9 These are famous cherry blossom sites in Hokkaidou; Matsumae Castle, 
Goryoukaku [go-ryou-kaku] Castle (in Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture), 
rows of cherry trees leading to Noboribetsu Hot Spring (in Noboribetsu City in 
Iburi sub-prefecture), Nijikken Road in Shizunai (in today's Shin-hidaka Town 
in Hidaka sub-prefecture), and Shiokari Pass (in Wassamu Town in Kamikawa sub-
prefecture).
   These are the main varieties of cherry for flowers; Yaezakura (double-
flowered cherry) and many other varieties including Somei-yoshino in Matsmae 
Castle; Somei-yoshino in Goryoukaku [go-ryou-kaku] Castle; and Ezo-yamazakura 
(mountain cherry) in Shizunai.
   The best time to see cherry blossoms varies year by year, but generally, it 
is from late April to mid May in Matsumae Town and from early to mid May in 
Shizunai Town.
   Somei-yoshino is the most famous cherry variety in the country. It was bred 
in Somei village near Edo (today's center of Tokyo) in the end of the Edo era. T
he village 
was located near today's Ikebukuro.
   Somei-yoshino was named after Mt. Yoshino, a famous cherry blossom site in 
Nara Prefecture. One of the oldest Somei-yoshino tree in the country grows at 
Matsumae Castle. It was planted in 1882 (Meiji 15). 
   Trees of Somei-yoshino are clones. If the soil and climate are the same, 
they grow in the same shape. Therefore, they are used as an indicator of 
cherry's blossom time.
   Making plant clones are easier than animal clones. Clones are more alike 
than siblings. Plant clones are the predecessors of today's digital society.

   Fukushima [fu-ku-shi-ma] [\u798F\u5CF6] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, 
south Hokkaidou (Dou-nan). The area faces the Tsugaru Strait to the south. The 
rivers of Fukushima and Shiriuchi flow. Mt. Daisengen (1072 m) rises to the 
north. Forests cover 93% of the area. Matsumae county, which consist of 
Matsumae Town and Fukushima Town, is located in the southern end of Hokkaidou.
   The name Fukushima is Japanese. ``Fuku-shima'' means ``lucky, island.'' It 
is an good-luck name that was given by an oracle from Tsukizaki Shrine in 1624. 
#1 #2
   The first Japanese immigrants to Ezo (now Hokkaidou) came from Ooshuu (now 
Touhoku region) in 1189. They were vassals of the Fujiwara clan that were 
defeated by Yoritomo Minamoto (Yoritomo Minamoto established the Kamakura 
Shogunate after he conquered Ooshuu).
   The first immigrants to Ezo lived in what is now Yoshioka district in 
Fukushima Town. In the mid-15th century, there was a fort (Onnai-date) in 
Yoshioka district. The fort was destroyed by the Ainu forces during Koshamain's 
War. (See the note of Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the war.)
   In the Edo era, the area was ruled by the Matsumae Domain. Around 1617, a 
gold mine was opened in Mt. Daisengen. Catholic gold miners gathered on the 
mountain. #3
   In the beginning of the Meiji period, the area belonged to the Tate Domain 
(it was renamed from the Matsumae Domain; see Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-
prefecture for Tate Domain). In 1879 (Meiji 12), two administrative office 
(kochou-yakuba) were established; one was for villages of Fukushima and Shirafu 
[\u767D\u7B26] and the other was for villages of Yoshioka [\u5409\u5CA1], 
Reihige [\u793C\u9AED], and Miyanouta [\u5BAE\u6B4C] villages.
   In 1900 (Meiji 33), Fukushima Village (1st-class municipality) was 
established by the merger of Fukushima village and Shirafu village. (See the 
note of Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 1st-class and 2nd-class 
municipalities.) In 1902 (Meiji 35), Yoshioka Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established by the merger of Yoshioka, Reihige, and Miyanouta villages. In 
1944 (Shouwa 19), Fukushima Town was established. In 1955 (Shouwa 30), 
Fukushima Town merged Yoshioka Village.
   The town hall and the center of Fukushima Town are located near the mouth 
of the Fukushima River. National Route 228 (Fukuyama-kaidou) runs there. 
Previously, the Matsumae Line ran along the national highway. The railway 
connected Matsumae Station in Matsumae Town and Kikonai Station in Kikonai 
Town. On the Kaikyou Line, there was Yoshioka-kaitei Station, which was an 
undersea station of the Seikan Tunnel. #4 #5
   Distinctive industries of Fukushima are fishery and forestry. FAMING = paddy 
rice X (concealed) in 2015; dairy cows - (zero) in 2015. FISHERY =  squid 
(flying squid 895 tons in 2017, other squid 26), sea urchins 85, tuna 66, 
octopus 48, seaweed (Konbu kelp 24, other seaweed 10), olive flounder 6, trout 
6, atka mackerel 6, right-eye flounder 1, abalone 1, herring 0, other fish 10, 
and other marine animals 3.
   Fishing ports are located in Fukushima, Yoshioka, Shirafu, and Urawa. The 
catch of squid accounts for about 80% of the fishery. Fukushima and neighboring 
Matsumae are the leading producers of Surume (dried flying squid) in the 
country. (See Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for Surume production.) As 
for forestry, the main trees are cedar, fir (Todo-matsu), and spruce 
(Ezo-matsu). The ceder is sold as the trade-mark Dou-nan-sugi (South Hokkaidou 
Cedar). #6
   As for sightseeing in Fukushima Town, there are Seikan Tunnel Memorial Hall, 
Inou Tadataka Hokkaidou Survey Memorial Park, and Yokozuna Chiyo-no-Yama and 
Chiyo-no-Fuji Memorial Hall (``Yokozuna'' are the champions of Sumou 
wrestling). The country sign (gateway sign) of the town shows a squid Sumou 
wrestler. The name of the roadside station is Yokozuna-no-sato (the hometown 
of Sumou champions).

   #1 According to ``Fukushima-chou-shi (Fukushima Town history),'' once upon a 
time, Orikanai village was on the verge of being abandoned, because of a large 
fire and poor fishing. At the time, an oracle from Tsukisaki Shrine said; 
``The name Orikanai should be changed to Fukushima.''
   The name relates to Fukuyama, which was the neighboring castle town 
(today's Matsumae Town). In Japanese, ``Fuku-yama'' means ``lucky, mountain'' 
and ``Fuku-shima'' means ``lucky, island.
   The old name Orikanai came from the Ainu word horka-nay (reverse, river). It 
meant the Fukushima River. Seawater entered the estuary at high tide, 
therefore, it was a ``reverse river.'' The meaning is the same as Horokanai 
Town in Kamikawa sub-prefecture. 
  #2 These are old shrines in Fukushima; Tsukisaki Shrine (reconstructed in 
1492), Fukushima Daijinguu Shrine (reconstructed in 1573), Shirafu Daijinguu 
Shrine (established by the Matsumae Domain in 1655), and Kamaya Shrine 
(established in 1772).
   Shirafu-arauma-odori is a traditional dance inherited in of Shirafu 
Daijinguu Shrine. It has been designated as a national cultural heritage.
   The name ``arauma'' means ``wild horse'' or ``bucking horse,'' and the dance 
represents the power of the Matsumae Domain.
   Kamaya Shrine is located in Shiogama district. ``Shio-gama'' in Japanese 
means ``salt, pot.'' The name came from salt production for sardine fishing in 
the past.
  #3 Mt. Daisengen [dai-sen-gen] in Japanese and means ``large, 1000 houses.'' 
It signified 1000 houses of gold miners. During the Edo era, the Tokugawa 
Shogunate banned Christianity, however, the regulation was loose in Ezo island, 
because the island was seen as an outer land (Gaichi). 
   Christians revolted in Kyuushuu island in 1637. That led to the execution of 
Christians in Ezo island in 1639. At the site of the gold mine in Mt. 
Daisengen, there is an inscription that reads ``Christian martyrdom.''
  #4 As for Fukuyama-kaidou (Fukuyama trail), ``Fukuyama'' refers the former 
Matsumae Town. The Fukuyama-kaidou was an old trail that connected Fukuyama 
Castle (Matsume Castle) and Hakodate. The Matsumae Domain's samurais walked the 
distance of about 100km.
   Cf. Matsumae-kaidou was located in Tsugaru, now Aomori Prefecture. (See the 
note of Hokuto City in Oshima sub-prefecture for Matsumae-kaidou).
  #5 The Seikan Tunnel is a railway tunnel. The length is 54 kilometers. Cf. 
Channel Tunnel (Le tunnel sous la Mance) between England and France is 50 
kilometers and Gotthard Base Tunnel in Switzerland is 57 kilometers.
   Yoshioka-kaitei Station in Fukushima Town was built at 150 meters under the 
sea. The station was used for the maintenance of the under-sea tunnel and 
sightseeing. Yoshioka-kaitei Station was closed in 2006 and demolished in 2014. 
   Yoshioka district in Fukushima Town was the base for the construction of 
Seikan Tunnel. The undersea tunnel was constructed from 1961 to 1988. Yoshioka 
district was flourished during the construction. (See Kikonai Town and Hakodate 
City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the undersea tunnel.)
   #6 Cedar ['si-dar] trees are not common in Hokkaidou, so cedar pollen fever 
is rare in the island, however, white birch and alder cause pollen fever. 
   I did not hear about pollen fever when I was a child in the 1970s. The cedar 
forests in Japan were still young at the time. Cedars grow even on wet land, so 
farmers planted cedars on abandoned rice paddies near valley heads. It happened 
during the high economic growth period between the late 1960s and the early 
1970s.

   Shiriuchi [shi-ri-u-chi] [\u77E5\u5185] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, 
south Hokkaidou (Dou-nan). It is located in the southwest of the Oshima 
Peninsula. The part of the peninsula is called Matsumae Peninsula. The area of 
Shiriuchi faces the Tsugaru Strait to the east. Forests cover 87% of the area.
   The name Shiriuchi came from the Ainu word cir-ot-i (bird, exist, place). It 
signified the Shiriuchi River. In the Edo era, Shiriuchi was a hunting ground 
for hawks and falcons. Young hawks and falcons were caught and shipped to Edo 
(today's center of Tokyo) for falconry. #1
   In 1205, the feudal lord of Kai Province (now Yamanashi Prefecture) started 
gold dust gathering along the Shiriuchi River. It was started by the order of 
the Kamakura Shogunate. In the 15th century, there was a fort called Wakimoto-
date [da-te]. It was one of the 12 forts that were built by the Andou clan from 
Tsugaru (now Aomori Prefecture). During the Edo era, the area was ruled by the 
Matsumae Domain. #2
   After the Meiji period, an administrative office (kochou-yakuba) was 
established in 1871 (Meiji 4). It was a continuation of village chief system 
from the Edo era. In 1881 (Meiji 14), an administrative office (kochou-yakuba) 
of Shiriuchi village was established. It also managed Kotaniishi 
[\u5C0F\u8C37\u77F3] village (by ``Shin-Shiriuchi-choushi (new Shiriuchi Town 
history)'' published in 2015). In 1906 (Meiji 39), Shiriuchi Village (2nd-class 
municipality) was established by the merger of Shiriuchi and Kotaniishi 
villages. (See the note of Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 1st-class 
and 2nd class municipalities). In 1967 (Shouwa 42), Shiriuchi Town was 
established.
   The town hall of Shiriuchi and the center of the town are located near the 
mouth of the Shiriuchi River. National Route 228 (Fukuyama-kaidou) crosses the 
Shiriuchi River (``Fukuyama'' means the castle town of the Matsumae Domain and 
the name of the former Matsumae Town). The national highway runs along the 
coast, goes inland from the center of the town, and leads to Fukushima Town. 
Previously, the Matsumae Line of Japanese National Railways ran along the 
national highway. There was another Shiriuchi Station on the Kaikyou Line. The 
station became a roadside station (Michi-no-eki). Visitors can watch the 
Shinkansen coming out of the undersea tunnel. #3 #4
   Distinctive industries of Shiriuchi are agriculture, fishery, forestry, and 
power generation. FARMING; paddy rice 422 hectares in 2015, soybeans 124, 
buckwheat 85, pasture 54, fodder 18, spinach 14, wheat 3, potatoes 2, orchards 
1, flowers 1, other vegetables 95+X (including Nira (Chinese chive or 
gynmigit)); and dairy cows 112 head in 2015.
   FISHERY; squid (flying squid 296 tons in 2017, other squid 20), salmon 66, 
sea urchins 30, seaweed 13 (Konbu kelp), shellfish 11 (oysters), olive flounder 
10, right-eye flounder 6 (marbled flounder), octopus 5, anchovy 4, yellowtail 
4, sharks 1, mackerel 1, herring 0, other fish 20, and other marine animals 3.
   According to a study of agricultural regionalization, the town was 
classified as ``small-scale and single-crop production of paddy rice'' area. 
According to the decline in rice consumption in the country, the area of paddy 
rice decreased and the area of Nira increased (Nira is included in Gyouza 
dumplings). Today, Shiriuchi is the largest producer of Nira in Hokkaidou. Nira 
is cultivated in greenhouses and harvested from January to October. #5 #6

   #1 As for the name Shiriuchi (``bird, exist, place'' in Ainu), in the Edo 
era, the Matsumae Domain traded hawks and falcons (Taka and Hayabusa in 
Japanese). Among bird-catching places in Ezo (old Hokkaidou), Shiriuchi was one 
of the best. Taka-machi (hawk catchers) searched nests of hawks in summer. They 
wintered in Ezo, caught chicks of hawks in spring, and sent them to the 
Tokugawa Shogunate. Feathers of hawks were also traded, because they were used 
as arrow fletchings.
   The Ainu also caught hawks and sold them to the Japanese. Ainu hunters hid 
in huts nearby streams, using salmon as lure. When hawks came, Ainu hunters 
caught them by hooking their legs. The Ainu also kept hawks to take feathers.
   Cf. The Ainu also kept young bears. See bear ranch in Noboribetsu City, 
Iburi sub-prefecture.
   #2 Shiriuchi Town has a long history of Japanese immigrants. Wakimoto Shrine 
in Kitsune-goshi district was established in 1239. Raikou Shrine in the center 
of the town was established in 1244. Shiriuchi Hot Spring was discovered by 
gold miners in 1247. These are ones of the oldest in Hokkaidou.
   In the past, priests in shrines were like village chiefs because they could 
write documents.
   The fort Wakimoto-date was located in Wakimoto district, Shiriuchi Town. 
It was located near Cape Kitsune-goshi. The fort was destroyed by the Ainu 
forces during Koshamain's War. (See Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 
the war.)
   #3 As for the topography of Shiriuchi Town, the road along the sea is a dead 
end because of a steep sea cliff.
   Cape Kitsune-goshi is located to the south of Wakimoto district, one of the 
oldest villages in Hokkaidou. To the west of Cape Kitsune-goshi, Kotaniishi 
district is located. To the west of Kotaniishi district is dead end at Cape 
Yagoshi.
   Cape Yagoshi is a sea cliff of 121 meter high. There is no footpath. 
Yagoshi in Japanese means ``arrow, pass'' and Kitusne-goshi in Japanese 
means ``fox, pass.''
   #4 In the observatory of Siriuchi Roadside Station, there is a time table of 
the Shinkansen trains entering and leaving the undersea tunnel (Seikan Tunnel). 
Part of the former Shiriuchi Station on the Kaikyou Line became Yu-no-sato 
Signal Station. Yu-no-sato is the end of the undersea tunnel.
   On the former Matsumae Line, there was Yu-no-sato Station. Yu-no-sato in 
Japanese means ``village of hot spring.'' It is a name of district along the 
Shiriuchi River. Shiriuchi Hot Spring is located there. (See Kikonai Town in 
Oshima sub-prefecture for the Kaikyou Line.)
   #5 As for fishery in Shiriuchi, oysters are cultivated in the open sea. It 
is a unique method because oysters are typically farmed along coastlines. 
Shiriuchi's oysters are advertised at tasting events in Susukino, the largest 
entertainment district in Hokkaidou.
   As for power generation, Shiriuchi Power Plant, which is managed by 
Hokkaidou Electric Power Company, is located in Motomachi district to the 
south. The power station uses heavy oil and Orimulsion (a new fuel). In summer, 
the power company sells electricity to Tokyo Electric Power Company, because 
Tokyo metropolitan area consumes a huge amount of electricity during the hot 
summer.
   The electricity is conveyed using the power line inside the Seikan Tunnel. 
The undersea power line is a direct electric current, which is suitable for 
high voltage and long-distance transmission.
   #6 As for tourism, Shiriuchi is the hometown of Saburou Kitajima, who is a 
famous Enka singer (Enka is a traditional style Japanese music). There is 
Kitajima Memorial Museum in Hakodate City.
   When I guided a field excursion in Tokyo, I happened to pass by his 
residence. It was near the site of another Enka singer's residence. Young 
students did not know two of them.
   This is one of Kitajima's famous songs; Yosaku-wa-ki-wo-kiru, hey hey hoo 
(Yosaku cuts trees, hey hey hoo).
   When I hear the song, I imagine a forestry office (Eirin-sho) in Hokkaidou.

   Kikonai [ki-ko-na-i] [\u6728\u53E4\u5185] is a town in Oshima sub-
prefecture, south Hokkaidou (Dou-nan). The area is located in the southwest of 
the Oshima Peninsula. The part is also called Matsumae Peninsula. The area of 
Kikonai faces the Tsugaru Strait. Forests cover 88% of the area.
   The name Kikonai came from the Ainu word rir-o-nay (tide, enter, stream). It 
meant the Kikonai River. Saltwater entered the estuary of the river at high 
tide.
   In the 15th century, Nakano-date (a fort) was built. It was one of 12 forts 
in Ezo (old Hokkaidou). (See Kaminokuni Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the 
12 forts.) 
   In the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain ruled the area. The name Kikonai 
appears on the map of Ezo that was drawn by the Matsumae Domain in 1624.
   After the Meiji period, in 1879 (Meiji 12), an administrative office 
(kochou-yakuba) of Kikonai was established. In 1902 (Meiji 35), Kikonai Village 
(2nd-class municipality) was established. (See the note of Matsumae Town in 
Oshima sub-prefecture for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.) At the time, 
the villages of Kikonai, Kamatani [\u91DC\u8C37], Izumisawa [\u6CC9\u6CA2], 
Sakkari [\u672D\u82C5] were merged. In 1919 (Taishou 8), Kikonai Village (1st-cl
ass municipality) was established. In 1942 (Shouwa 17), Kikonai Town was 
established. #1 #2
   The town hall of Kikonai and the center of the town are located near the 
mouth of the Kikonai River. National Route 228 (Fukuyama-kaidou) runs through 
the center of the town. Kikonai Station on the Hokkaidou Shinkansen is the 
terminal of the Dou-nan Isaribi Railway. Isaribi in Japanese means ``fishing 
lamp.'' (The lamps are used for squid fishing, floating on the sea from June to 
December; see Hakodate City and Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 
squid fishing).
   In the past, the Esashi Line and the Matsumae Line ran. Kikonai was a 
transportation hub in the Matsumae Peninsula. Governmental offices were located 
in the center of the town such as a summary court, a forestry agency, and a 
railway yard by Japanese National Railways. Woodworking factories were also 
located near the station. (Incidentally, old television sets were made from 
wooden planks. Today, all desks and chairs are made of steel in Japanese 
offices). #3
  Distinctive industries of Kikonai are fishery, agriculture, animal husbandry 
(including Hakodate Wagyuu Beef), and forestry (including Dounan Ceder). 
FARMING; paddy rice 291 hectares in 2015, pasture 188, fodder 26, orchards 5, 
potatoes 4, spinach 2, soybeans 1, radishes 1, yams 1; dairy cows 291 head in 
2015, and beef cattle X (concealed).
   FISHERY; salmon 65 tons in 2017 (autumn salmon), sea urchins 22, seaweed 18 
(kelps of Konbu, Wakame, and Iwa-nori), shellfish (abalone 1, other shellfish 
10), olive flounder 14, right-eye flounder 9 (marbled flounder), octopus 8, 
mackerel 5, sharks 4, yellowtail 1, Pacific cod 1, herring 0, other fish 7, and 
other marine animals 6. #4
   The country sign (gateway sign) of Kikonai signifies Kanchuu-misogi, which 
means ``winter, purification'' in Japanese. It is a festival that started in 
1831. During the festival, people go into the sea in the middle of winter 
(although the temperature of the sea is warmer than rivers and lakes in winter, 
the location is Hokkaidou island).

   #1 As for the Boshin War, the battle of Kikonai happened in 1869 (Meiji 2).
The Meiji government forces advanced from Esashi to Hakodate and the former 
Tokugawa Shogunate forces counter-attacked. One of the routes taken by the 
Meiji government forces was the Kikonai Mountain Trail. (See Hakodate City in 
Oshima sub-prefecture for the Boshin War.)
   #2 In 1871 (Meiji 4), Kanrin-maru (a ship) sank at Cape Saraki in Kikonai. 
The ship's anchor is displayed in Kikonai Town's museum. There is a monument to 
the ship ``End-of-Kanrin-Mauru'' along National Route 228. 
   Kanrin-maru was a battleship that the Tokugawa Shogunate purchased from the 
Netherlands. It was the first Japanese ship that crossed the Pacific Ocean. 
   In 1860, to complete the conclusion of the Japan-US Treaty of Amity and 
Commerce, Kanrin-maru departed from the Port of Shinagawa on January 13th. The 
ship arrived in the Port of San Francisco on February 26th. The captain was 
Kaishuu Katsu and the interpreter was Manjirou John. On the outbound voyage, 
bad weather caused the Japanese crew to be sea-sick and Americans took over 
piloting.
   In 1867, the ship's steam was removed. It became a cargo ship. After the 
Meiji period, the new government owned the ship and it sank in a heavy storm 
in September 1871 along the coast of Kikonai.
   #3 JR Hokkaidou's Hokkaidou Shinkansen opened in 2016, and a section of the 
Esashi Line between Goryoukaku [go-ryou-kaku] Station (in Hakodate City) and 
Kikonai Station (in Kikonai Town) changed to the Dou-nan Isaribi Railway. The 
former Esashi Line ran along the Tsugaru Strait, entered mountains from Kikonai 
Town, and went to Esashi Town in the sea of Japan side. 
   In 2012, Kikonai High School was closed. In 2014, a section between Kikonai 
Station and Esahi Station on the Esashi Line closed. High school students were 
the main users of the local railway. Part of the railway was converted to a 
trolley line for sightseeing.
   Kikonai Station on Hokkaidou Shinkansen is also the terminal of the Kaikyou 
Line. The Kakyou Line runs through the undersea Seikan Tunnel. After the 
Hokkaidou Shinkansen opened, only freight trains and special trains for group 
tours use the Kaikyou Line.
   The Hokkaidou Shinkansen also uses the same undersea tunnel, however, the 
Shinkansen is not the Kaikyou line. The track gauge (distance between two 
rails) is different between the Shinkansen and conventional railways including 
the Kaikyou Line. The Seikan Tunnel was made as a dual-gauge (three rails) and 
double-truck railway (six rails in total; see Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-
prefecture for the undersea tunnel). 
   The former Matsumae Line connected Kikonai Station and Matsumae Station. The 
Matsumae Line was abolished in 1988. It was two years after the privatization 
of JNR (Japanese National Railways). There used to be many railways and their 
branch routes in Hokkaidou. This is because many local politicians promised 
many railways.
   #4 As for dairy farming in Kikonai, in 1897 (Meiji 30), a milk collection 
facility was built. Horse-drawn carriage shipped raw milk to Toubetsu Trappist 
Monastery. In 1919 (Taishou 8), condensed milk butter was also produced. (See 
Hokuto City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the monastery; See Eniwa City in 
Ishikari sub-prefecture for dairy farming.)

   Hokuto [ho-ku-to] [\u5317\u6597] is a city in Oshima sub-prefecture, south 
Hokkaidou (Dou-nan). It faces Hakodate Bay and the Tsugaru Strait. The rivers 
of Moheji, Oono, and Kunebetsu flow.
   The name Hokuto is Japanese. It means the Big Dipper that shines in the 
north sky. It was named by public offering when Kamiiso [\u4E0A\u78EF] and Oono 
[\u5927\u91CE] towns were merged in 2006. #1
   In the mid 15th century, Mobetsu-date [da-te] (a fort) was built near the 
mouth of the Moheji River. (See Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for 
old forts in south Hokkaidou.) In the Edo era, the area was ruled by the 
Matsumae Domain.
   After the Meiji period, in 1880 (Meiji 13), administrative offices (kochou-
yakuba) were established in Kamiiso and Oono villages. In 1885 (Meiji 18), an 
administrative office was established in Moheji [\u8302\u8FBA\u5730] village. 
In 1900 (Meiji 33), Kamiiso Village (1st-class municipality) and Oono Village 
(1st-class municipality) were established. (See the note of Matsumae Town in 
Oshima sub-prefecture for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.)
   In 1906 (Meiji 39), Mobetsu [\u8302\u5225] Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established by the merger of Moheji and Ishibetsu [\u77F3\u5225] villages. 
In 1918 (Taishou 7), Kamiiso Town was established. In 1955 (Shouwa 30), Kamiiso 
Town merged Mobetsu Village. In 1957 (Shouwa 32), Oono Town was established.
   The city hall of Hokuto is located near the mouth of the Oono River. It used 
to be the town hall of Kamiiso. National Route 228 (Fukuyama-kaidou) and the 
Dou-nan Isaribi Railway run through the center of the city. (See Kikonai Town 
in Oshima sub-prefecture for the Dou-nan Isaribi Railway; See Fukushima Town in 
Oshima sub-prefecture for Fukuyama-kaidou.)
   To the south, residential, commercial, and manufacturing areas extend from 
the center of Hakodate City. To the north, National Route 227 (Oono-kokudou) 
runs through the Oono Plain and crosses the ridge to Esashi Town. Shin-
hakodate-hokuto Station on the Hokkaidou Shinkansen is located near the border 
with Nanae Town. It used to be Oshima-Oono Station on the Hakodate Main Line. 
The population of Hokuto City increased. #2
   Distinctive industries of Hokuto are manufacturing, agriculture, and 
fishery. FARMING; paddy rice 1198 hectares in 2015, fodder 659, beans (soybeans 
239, adzuki beans 9, other beans 5), green onions 131, pasture 110, radishes 
57, tomatoes 50, potatoes 39, spinach 37, cabbage 28, Chinese cabbage 16, 
lettuce 14, cucumbers 14, orchards 11, strawberries 9, yams 6, flowers 4, 
onions 2, other vegetables 139+X, other grains 8, other fruits 1; and dairy 
cows 336 head in 2015.
   FISHERY; salmon 387 tons in 2017, anchovy 242, yellowtail 88, shellfish 
(abalone 1, Manila clam 1, other shellfish 74), herring 51, right-eye flounder 
37, Pacific cod 34, olive flounder 26, crabs 25, squid (flying squid 21, other 
squid 1), seaweed 21, sea urchins 15, mackerel 13, octopus 11, trout 7, puffer 
fish 2, red seabream 1, other fish 44+X, and other marine animals 10.
   On satellite images, a straight line stretches to Hakodate Bay. It is a 
jetty of Taiheiyou Cement Kamiiso Factory. The limestone deposit of the cement 
industry was discovered in 1872 by Benjamin Smith Lyman, who was an American 
mining scholar invited by the Meiji government. #3
   As for agriculture in Hokuto, paddy rice cultivation started in Oono 
district in the late 17th century. It was the first rice cultivation in 
Hokkaidou. As for sightseeing, the old building shown on the country sign 
(gateway sign) is Toubetsu Trappist Monastery. It is located to the west, near 
the border with Kikonai Town. The monastery has old red-brick buildings and 
tree-lined avenues. #4 #5

   #1 As for the history of Hokuto City, the former Kamiiso Town was located 
along Hakodate Bay. The name Kamiiso was derived from Kamiiso county, which was 
established in 1869 (Meiji 2). The county's name was suggestion by Takeshirou 
Matsuura, an explorer of Ezo (old Hokkaidou) in the Edo era. Kami-iso in 
Japanese means ``upper, coast.'' The ``upper'' refers to the west, where the 
castle of the Matsumae Domain was located. 
   Or, the name was derived from Kamiiso-kaidou (an old trail) in Tsugaru (now 
Aomori Prefecture). The another name of Kamiiso-kaidou was Matsumae-kaidou. It 
connected Abura-kawa (in today's Aomori City) and Min-maya (in today's Sotoga-
hama Town, Aomori Prefecture). 
   Cf. The old trail that connected the castle town of the Matsumae Domain 
(today's Matsumae Town) and the Port of Hakodate was called Fukuyama-kaidou. 
(See Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-prefecture.)
   In the Edo era, there were villages of Arikawa [\u6709\u5DDD] and Hekirichi 
[\u6238\u5207\u5730] in today's Kamiiso district. The former Oono Town was 
located inland. ``Oo-no'' is Japanese and means ``large, plain.'' It is an old 
name that was documented in the Gouchou [\u90F7\u5E33] (village record) written 
in 1700 (Edo era).
   #2 As for landscape in Hokuto City, when I was traveling on Fukuyama-kaidou 
(National Route 228), I saw many concrete wave-breaking blocks along the 
coast. Hokuto is one of the largest producer of cement in the country. Cement 
is a material of concrete.
   Wave-breaking blocks are known as Tetrapods in Japan. It was the patent of 
Neyrpic, a French company. I heard like this from Professor Sunamura at 
University of Tsukuba (HTTP://2242.MOOO.COM/POSI/95IZU/1452-950303.JPG); When 
Neyrpic executives visited Japan, they saw many fake Tetrapods along the coast. 
Then, Nippon Tetrapod, a branch of Neyrpic, was established in 1961. The fake 
Tetrapods in Japan had metal hooks for lifting, so they were easy to install, 
however, they were less durable. The metal hook corrodes.
   #3 As for cement industry in Hokuto City, Taiheiyou Cement extracts 
limestone at Garou Mine. The cement is transported to the pier via two 
kilometers' jetty. That makes a long line on the map.
   In 1884 (Meiji 17), a cement factory was established. In 1890 (Meiji 23), it 
became Hokkaidou Cement. In 1915 (Taishou 4), it was purchased by Asano Cement. 
   After World War II, Asano zaibatsu, which was a conglomerate including Asano 
Cement, was dismantled, and Asano Cement changed its name to Nihon Cement. In 
1988 (Shouwa 63), Nihon Cement and Chichibu Onoda Cement were merged to 
establish Taiheiyou Cement.
   Limestone is a self-sufficient resource in Japan. Today, almost all 
electricity poles are made of concrete (concrete is made from cement, and 
cement is made from limestone). The oldest concrete electricity pole is still 
used in neighboring Hakodate City. The concrete electricity pole was installed 
in 1923 (Taishou 12) to prevent it from burning by fire.
   Today, many tourist destinations hide electricity poles under the earth, 
although old electricity poles are attractive.
   #4 As for agriculture in Hokuto City, the former Oono Town is the birth 
place of paddy rice cultivation in Hokkaidou. It started in the Edo era. There 
is a stone monument that commemorates the first paddy rice cultivation. The 
inscription reads; In 1692, a farmer Sakuemon opened a paddy filed of 450 
tsubo (0.15 hectares) using natural water and gained rice of 10 hyou (600 kg).
   The record was excellent at the time. Today, a good paddy field has a yield 
of 600kg per 0.1 hectares. Such paddy is called jippyo-dori (10-hyou gaining). 
   According to oral tradition, paddy rice cultivation in the former Oono Town 
dates back to before the inscription. Paddy rice was cultivated in the Kanbun 
period (1661-1672) and in 1685 (by T. Hoshino ed. 1994 ``Hokkaidou-no-inasaku 
(Rice cultivation of Hokkaidou)'').
    Kametarou Ootomo was an engineer in the end of the Edo era. He instructed 
agriculture in Oono village (the former Oono Town in Hokuto City). Then, he 
moved to Sapporo in 1866 and constructed the Ootomo Canal (today's Sousei 
River).
   Kyuuzou Nakayama was known as the father of cold-climate paddy rice 
cultivation in the Meiji period. He obtained rice seeds in Oono village and 
succeeded in paddy rice cultivation in the Ishikari Plain. (See Kita-hiroshima 
City in Ishikari sub-prefecture for cold-climate rice cultivation.)
   #5 Toubetsu Trappist Monastery in Hokuto City was established in 1896 (Meiji 
29). The monks started dairy farming. Dairy farming spread to Kikonai village 
in the Meiji period. Today, the monastery sells butter, ice cream, and cookies. 
   A monastery is a place where monks live together. It is Catholic. It is also 
Catholic to have statues of Mary and saints, but they do not pray to them (not 
idolatry). In the past, many people could not read, therefore, they made 
statues.
   Today, university teachers use a lot of PowerPoint. The situation is like 
idolatry.

   Hakodate [ha-ko-da-te] [\u51FD\u9928] is a city in Oshima sub-prefecture, 
south Hokkaidou (Dou-nan). The area occupies the southeast of the Oshima 
Peninsula. The part is called Kameda Peninsula. The area of Hakodate faces 
Hakodate Bay, Tsugaru Strait, and the Pacific Ocean.
   Mt. Hakodate stands from Hakodate Bay. The height is 334 meters (cf. Tokyo 
Tower is 333 meters). The area of Hakodate was newly formed in 2004 by the 
merger of Hakodate City, Toi Town, Minami-kayabe Town, Esan Town, and Todohokke 
Village. #1 #2 #3 #4
   The name Hako-date means ``box, fort'' in Japanese. It referred to the shape 
of a fort, whose name was Usukeshi-date. The fort was managed by the Kouno 
clan since 1454. The Kouno clan was one of the vassals of the Andou clan, which 
built 12 forts, including Usukeshi-date, in today's south Hokkaidou. They were 
immigrated from Tsugaru (today's Aomori Prefecture) in the 15th century. 
During Koshamain's War in 1457, Usukeshi-date, so-called Hako-date, was 
destroyed by the Ainu forces. Koshamain was a chief of the Ainu. (See 
Kaminokuni Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the Andou clan and Koshamain's 
War.)
   In the Edo era, the Port of Hakodate was managed by the Matsumae Domain and 
later by the Tokugawa Shogunate. The port was opened for American ships in 1854 
under the Convention of Kanagawa (Japan-US Treaty of Peace and Amity). #5 
   In the beginning of the Meiji period, Hakodate became the battle ground of 
the Boshin War (1868-1869). In 1869 (Meiji 2), the Hokkaidou Development 
Commission was established (its head office moved from Hakodate to Sapporo in 
1871). In 1879 (Meiji 12), Hakodate became a ward [\u533A] (an administrative 
district). In 1899 (Meiji 32), Hakodate Ward (a local government) was 
established. (See Kushiro Town in Kushiro sub-prefecture for wards in 
Hokkaidou.) #6
   In 1922 (Taishou 11), Hakodate City was established. In 1939 (Shouwa 14), 
Hakodate City merged Yunokawa [\u6E6F\u5DDD] Town (1st-class municipality, 
whose area was around Yunokawa Hot Spring). In 1966 (Shouwa 41), Hakodate City 
merged Zenigame-zawa [\u92AD\u4E80\u6CA2] Village (the former 1st-class 
municipality, whose area was around Hakodate Airport). In 1973 (Shouwa 48), 
Hakodate City merged Kameda [\u4E80\u7530] City. (See the note of Matsumae Town 
in Oshima sub-prefecture for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.) #7
   The city hall of Hakodate and the Port of Hakodate are located at the foot 
of Mt. Hakodate. National Route 5 and the Hakodate Main Line start from the 
port of Hakodate. Hakodate was the gateway of Hokkaidou from the late 19th 
century to the late 20th century. In the past, Seikan train-ferries (Seikan-
renraku-sen) connected Hakodate and Aomori. The name Seikan (Sei-kan) in 
Japanese is an abbreviation of Aomori and Hakodate.
   Hakodate's population peaked in 1980 at 345,165 (including municipalities of 
Toi, Esan, Minami-kayabe, and Todohokke). The population decreased because of 
the end of pelagic fishing (deep-sea fishing), opening of the Seikan Tunnel, an 
increase in air travelers, and motorization. #8 #9
   Distinctive industries of Hakodate are sightseeing, fishery, fish 
processing, trade, and ship-building. FARMING; potatoes 393 hectares in 2015, 
pasture 260, paddy rice 73, cabbage 54, beans (adzuki beans 19, soybeans 9, 
other beans 1), fodder 27, orchards 18, Chinese cabbage 16, green onions 10, 
flowers 8, broccoli 7, spinach 3, tomatoes 2, onions 1, cucumbers 1, other 
vegetables 47+X; and dairy cows 467 head in 2015.
   FISHERY; squid (flying squid 5660 tons in 2017, other squid 377), walleye 
pollock 5162, sardines 4889, yellowtail 4045, anchovy 2414, mackerel 1717,

puffer fish 21, marine mammals 18, kichiji 14, crabs 4, bonito 2, Hatahata 1, 
other fish 571+X, and other marine animals 122. #10
   As for sightseeing, famous tourist destinations are Goryoukaku [go-ryou-
kaku] Castle, Mt. Hakodate, night view from Mt. Hakodate, old Western-style 
buildings, old churches in Motomachi district, brick warehouses on an old 
wharf, Ekini market, Yunokawa Hot Spring, and landscape of slopes (saka-michi) 
filmed in movies and TV dramas.
   Goryoukaku [go-ryou-kaku] Castle was built inland to avoid artillery from 
ships. It was constructed between 1857 and 1866, after the Japan-US Treaty of 
Peace and Amity. The Tokugawa Shogunate was wary of foreign ships. Goryoukaku 
became the last castle of the Tokugawa Shogunate forces during the Boshin War 
and it fell. Today, tourists enjoy climbing up an observation tower in the 
castle with a height of 100m. #11
   The Western-style buildings from the Meiji period has been preserved, for 
example, Hokkaidou Government Hakodate Branch Office and Hakodate Ward Public 
Hall. They were constructed after the great fires in the Meiji period. At Ekini 
market, tourists can fish for squid. The market used to be a morning fair in 
front of Hakodate Station. #12 #13

   #1 Mt. Hakodate is also called Gagyuu-san in Japanese. It means ``lying cow 
mountain.'' It was named due to the shape. The top of Mt. Hakodate was removed 
by 14 meters when a battery was built in the Meiji period.
   It is said that the nature of the mountain remains because people could not 
enter the mountain easily. Mt. Hakodate was a military facility from the Meiji 
to the Shouwa periods.
   Actually, however, the native trees of Mt. Hakodate werecut for firewood and 
construction materials since a fort (so-called Hako-date) was built in the 15th 
century. Today, cedar trees can be seen along bus and ropeway routes. Ceder 
trees have been cultivated since the Edo era (about 200 years ago).
   The night view from Mt. Hakodate is counted as one of World Top Three Night 
Views, along with Hong Kong and Naples. Sometimes, Nagasaki is counted as the 
top three night views instead of Hakodate. Nagasaki is also a port city.
   Such top-three rankings were counted by the Japanese. In the past, the 
Japanese traveled around the world by ship. Japan was a maritime nation. (See 
Kushiro City in Kushiro sub-prefecture for World Top Three Sunset.)
   #2 Mt. Hakodate is a land-tied island. The city hall is located on a 
sandbar. The sandbar is called tombolo in geography. In the Meiji period, the 
central business district (CBD) of Hakodate was located on the sandbar.
   Since then, the CBD moved inland; to the front of Hakodate Station in the 
Shouwa period, and to the front of Goryoukaku [Go-ryou-kaku] Castle in the 
Heisei period. When I visited Hakodate City in 2013, ``For Rent'' signs 
were sticked on the second floor's windows near Hakodate Station.
   #3 The Tsugaru Strait has two necks; east neck and west neck (a neck is a 
narrow part of the sea). The east neck is between the Kameda Peninsula in 
Hakodate City and the Shimokita Peninsula in Aomori Prefecture. The west neck 
is between the Matsumae Peninsula in Matsumae Town and the Tsugaru Peninsula in 
Aomori Prefecture.
   The Seikan Tunnel (an undersea tunnel) was constructed in the west neck. 
The west neck is a little longer than the east neck but the water is shallower. 
(See the note of Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the distance of 
Tsugaru Strait; See Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the undersea 
tunnel.)
   #4 The former Toi [\u6238\u4E95] Town in Hakodate City was located in the 
south end of the Kameda Peninsula. The name was derived from the Ainu word toi-
o-i (edible soil, exist, place). It signified diatomite (Keisoudo). Toi was a 
village in the Edo era. The name Toi was recorded in Matsumae-tou-gou-chou 
(Matsumae island Gazetteer) [\u677E\u524D\u5CF6\u90F7\u5E33], which was 
published in the Tenpou period (1831-1845) in the Edo era. 
   After the Meiji period, in 1879 (Meiji 12), an administrative office 
(kochou-yakuba) of Toi was established. In 1902 (Meiji 35), Toi Village (2nd-
class municipality) was established. (See the note of Matsumae Town in Oshima 
sub-prefecture for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.) In 1919 (Taishou 
8), Toi Village (1st-class municipality) was established. In 1968 (Shouwa 43), 
Toi Town was established.
   The other side of the Tsugaru Strait from Toi is Ooma Town in Aomori 
Prefecture. Ooma is famous for Ooma tuna. The same tuna is caught in Toi. I 
heard these topics about tuna in the 2010s; The price of Toi's tuna is cheaper 
than Ooma tuna; The tuna caught in the Tsugaru Strait is delicious because they 
eat flying squid; Tuna are warm-water fish and has been caught in Hokkaidou 
after the 1990s.
   The former Minami-kayabe [\u5357\u8305\u90E8] Town in Hakodate City is 
located to the east of the Kameda Peninsula. (See Mori Town in Oshima sub-
prefecture for the name Kayabe.) In 1879 (Meiji 12), an administrative office 
(kochou-yakuba) was established in Osatsube [\u5C3E\u672D\u90E8]. In 1880 
(Meiji 13), an administrative office was established in Usujiri [\u81FC\u5C3B] 
village. Those villages existed in the Edo era. In 1906 (Meiji 39), Osatsube 
Village (2nd-class municipality) and Usujiri Village (2nd-class municipality) 
were established. In 1959 (Shouwa 39), Minami-kayabe Town was established by 
the merger of Osatsube Village and Usujiri Village.
   In 1975, a hollow clay figurine was dug from a potato field in Minami-
kayambe Town. It is the only national treasure in Hokkaidou. Previously, 
Matsumae Castle (Fukuyama Castle) was counted as a national treasure, but it 
was burned down. (See Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the castle.)
   The former Esan [\u6075\u5C71] Town in Hakodate City is located in the 
eastern end of the Kameda Peninsula. The area faces the Tsugaru Strait. In the 
the Edo era, Shirikishinai [\u5C3B\u5CB8\u5185] village was established. After 
the Meiji period, in 1872 (Meiji 5), an administrative office (kochou-yakuba) 
was established in Shirikishinai village. It was a continuation of village 
chief from the Edo era. In 1879 (Meiji 12), the administrative office of 
Shirikishinai village was re-established. In 1906 (Meiji 39), Shirikishinai 
Village (2nd-class municipality) was established. In 1964 (Shouwa), 
Shirikishinai Town was established. In 1985 (Shouwa 60), the name was changed 
to Esan.
   It was named after Mt. Esan (618 meters, volcano). The mountain's name was 
derived from the Ainu word e-san-i (head, stick out, place), which means a 
cape. Mt. Esan is an active volcano and its bare soil stands out from the 
Ocean.
   The former Todohokke [\u6934\u6CD5\u83EF] Village in Hakodate City is also 
located in the eastern end of the Kameda Peninsula. It was the smallest 
municipality in Hokkaidou (25 km2, as same as Atsubetsu Ward in Sapporo). The 
name came from the Ainu word tu-pok-ke (mountain foot, under, place). It 
signified the mountain foot of Mt. Esan. In the Edo era, Todohokke was 
included in Osatsube village. After the Meiji period, in 1880 (Meiji 13), an 
administrative office of Todohokke village was established. In 1919 (Taishou 
8), it became Todohokke Village (2nd-class municipality). (See the note of 
Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 1st-class and 2nd-class 
municipalities.) 
   #5 The Port of Hakodate was a natural port. The Japanese called it tsuna-
shirazu (rope, no need). They also called it Tomoe Port (spiral port) due to 
the spiral-like topography. The Japan-US Treaty of Peace and Amity was 
concluded in 1854 between the Tokugawa Shogunate and the United States, and 
ports of Hakodate and Shimoda (in today's Shizuoka Prefecture) were opened. It 
was due to the effort and pressure of Matthew Perry, the commander of the East 
India Squadron in the United States. On his black steamships, he appeared in 
many ports in Japan after 1853. The Japanese were surprised at the ships.
   In 1859, the Treaty of Amity and Commerce was concluded between the Tokugawa 
Shogunate and the United States. Along with Hakodate, ports of Kanagawa 
(Yokohama), Nagasaki, Hyougo (Koube), and Niigata were opened (Shimoda was 
closed instead of Kanagawa). Foreign settlements were built near the ports, 
and cities of Edo (today's center of Tokyo) and Oosaka were opened for foreign 
visitors.
   #6 The Boshin War was a civil war between the new Meiji government forces 
and the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces. The final phase of the war is called 
the Hakodate War. (See Kikonai, Matsumae, Mori towns in Oshima sub-prefecture, 
Assabu, Esashi, and Otobe towns in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the Boshin War.) 
   The commander of the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces was Takeaki Enomoto. 
He learned English from John Manjirou and studied in the Netherlands. After the 
defeat in the Boshin War, Enomoto was appointed by Kiyotaka Kuroda (an officer 
of the Meiji government forces), and worked for the Hokkaidou Development 
Commission with him.
   Toshizou Hijikata, an officer of the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces, was 
killed in the Hakodate War. In the Edo era, Hijikata was the vice-commander of 
Shinsen-gumi, which was the special police of the Tokugawa Shogunate.
   As for Shinsen-gumi, Shinpachi Nagakura was the strongest swordsman among 
the members. Near the main gate of Hokkaidou University, there is a small 
plaque to him. 
   Shinpachi Nagakura was born and raised in the Edo branch of the Matsumae 
Domain (Edo is today's center of Tokyo; the Matsumae Domain ruled today's 
Hokkaidou during the Edo era). He leaned swordmanship in Edo fled from the 
Matsumae Domain. He participated in the Boshin War but did not in the Hakodate 
War. At the time, he was a member of the Tokugawa Shogunate forces, so if he 
participated in the Hakodate War, he would have to fight against the Matsumae 
Domain, which was his former monarch.
   In the Meiji period, Shinpachi Nagakura taught swordsmanship at Kabato 
Prison and Hokkaidou University (at the time Touhoku Imperial University). It 
is said that swords seemed to be stopped to the swordsman.
   #7 As for the former Kameda City, which belongs to Hakodate City now, the 
name Kame-da in Japanese means ``turtle, rice field.'' It is a good-luck name 
as well as Chitose City in Ishikari sub-prefecture. ``Chitose'' in Japanese 
means ``1000 years,'' which was named after cranes. According to an old Chinese 
legend, cranes (tsuru) represent 1000 years and turtles (kame) represent 10,000 
years.
   In the early 17th century, the Matsumae Domain built a guardhouse (bansho) 
in Kameda. It was moved to Hakodate in the 18th century. After the Meiji 
period, from 1879 (Meiji 12) to 1881 (Meiji 14), eight administrative offices 
for 28 villages were established in Kameda county [\u4E80\u7530\u90E1]. 
   In 1902 (Meiji 23), Kameda Village (2nd-class municipality) was established. 
At the time, the villages of Kameda, Kamiyama [\u795E\u5C71], Kaji 
[\u935B\u51B6], Kikyou [\u6854\u6897], and Ishikawa [\u77F3\u5DDD] were merged.
(See the note of Matsumae Town for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.)
   In 1919 (Taishou 8), Kameda Village (1st-class municipality) was 
established. In 1962 (Shouwa 37), Kameda Town was established. In 1971 (Shouwa 
46), Kameda City was established. In 1973 (Shouwa 48), Hakodate City merged 
Kameda City. 
   Kameda City existed only for two years and one month. Cf. Fushimi City in 
Kyouto Prefecture existed only for one year and eleven months.
   The former Kameda City is located in the west of Hakodate City. The area 
includes stations of Goryoukaku [go-ryou-kaku] and Kikyou on the Hakodate Main 
Line. The address of Goryoukaku Station is Kameda-honchou, which means ``Kameda 
main town'' in Japanese.
   #8 As for the Port of Hakodate, Seikan train-ferries operated from 1908 
(Meiji 41) to 1988 (Shouwa 63). One of the ferries Touya-maru was sunk due to 
the Touya-maru Typhoon (Typhoon Marie) in September 1954. In the accident, 1155 
people died. Then, plans for the construction of the Seikan Tunnel (undersea 
tunnel) moved forward. (See Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the 
undersea tunnel.)
   There is a famous Japanese song Tsugaru-kaikyou-fuyu-geshiki (Tsugaru Strait 
winter scene). This is part of the lyrics; People who return to the north are 
quiet. They hear only the sound of the sea.
   This is my sales pitch to invite master students (when I worked for 
Hokkaidou University); It will be good to live in the north island for two 
years. Cities in Honshuu island are too hot.
   Travelers from Honshuu island would think that Hakodate and Sapporo are 
close because they are in the same prefecture. However, between Hakodate and 
Sapporo, it takes 4 hours by express train, 4 hours by expressway, and 5.5 
hours by bus. The route goes around Uchiura Bay (Volcano Bay).
   #9 With the establishment of Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ, a 200 nautical 
mile zone), deep-sea fishing came to an end. In the past, ports of Hakodate, 
Kushiro, and Nemuro were the bases of deep-sea fishing. Groups of ships 
departed those ports and caught salmon near Russian and US Alaskan waters. 
   Hakodate was the base of mother-ship (bosen) type fishing. Kushiro and 
Nemuro were the bases of mother-port (bokou) type fishing. In the mother-ship 
type fishing, canned salmon were processed in the mother ship. Incidentally, 
there is ``mother'' in the word ``sea'' in French (``mer'' and ``mere 
[m\u00E8re]'') and in Japanese (``haha [\u6BCD]'' and ``umi [\u6D77]'').
   #10 As for trade in Hakodate City, the main importing countries and 
importing goods are Russia (coal, fish), China (fish), and South Korea 
(petroleum products). The main exporting country and exports are Panama and 
flag-of-convenience ships (data for 2011 from Hakodate Customs). Russian coal 
is used in the cement industry in Hokuto City.
   As for the ship-building, Hakodate Dock produces bulk carriers, cement 
carriers, and fishing boats. As for fishery, squid are caught off the coast 
from June to December. Fishing lights float on the sea during the season. It is 
a fantastic scenery.
   #11 As for the landscape of slopes in Hakodate, port cities have slopes, for 
example, San Francisco, Rio de Janeiro, and Nagasaki.
  Japan is a mountainous country. Hilly and sloping roads are generally 
winding. Sloping roads in Hakodate are straight to the sea. (See Yuni Town in 
Sorachi sub-prefecture for straight roads.)
   #12 The center of Hakodate suffered many fires. Large fires occurred in 1879 
(Meiji 12), 1899 (Meiji 32), 1907 (Meiji 40), 1934 (Shouwa 9), and 1945 (Shouwa 
25, air raids). There is a buffer zone near the city hall, where Tochi-no-ki
(horse chestnut) were planted. In Honsyuu island, it is said that Mochi-no-ki 
(bird-lime holly, a kind of forever-green broad-leaved tree) is good for 
preventing the spread of fire.
   #13 I visited Hakodate on field excursions in May 2013 and May 2017. In both 
years, a Toshizou Hijikata Look-alike Contest was held at Goryoukaku [go-ryou-
kaku] Castle. Toshizou Hijikawa was the commander of the former Tokugawa 
Shogunate forces, who dead in Hakodate at the end of the Boshin War. The winner 
of the look-alike contest in 2017 was a woman.
   As for the tram in Hakodate, a very old car runs with a ticket seller on 
board. A red car also run. It is said that when you see the red tram, you will 
be happy. The tram's last stop is Yunokawa Hot Spring. It is Oku-zashiki (so-
called an inner parlor) of Hakodate. The hot spring was opened by the Matsumae 
Domain in 1653. In the hot spring area, there was a nice and inexpensive inn 
where we stayed during field trips. Today, it is difficult to stay at the inn, 
because it became popular with foreign tourists.
   Local foods of Hakodate include Lucky Pierrot hamburgers, Madalena cookies 
of Trappistine Monastery, curry and rice, and grilled-chicken lunch-box of 
Hasegawa Store. The restaurant Gotouken that was opened in the Meiji period 
became famous for its curry and rice. Today, tourists enjoy curry and rice even 
in the morning at hotel buffets. Curry was brought to Japan via the British 
Navy (India, the original place of curry and rice, was a colony of the British 
Empire), therefore, the former navy cities such as Hakodate and Yokosuka appeal 
their curry and rice. In Hokkaidou, American teachers at Sapporo Agricultural 
Collage also introduced curry and rice. (See Kita Ward in Sapporo City for 
Sapporo Agricultural Collage.)
   As for Lucky Pierrot hamburgers, I heard like this; ``It is popular than 
McDonald in Hakodate. They serve whale hamburgers. The hamburgers are large.
The shops are located in front of high schools (they are hungry after 
school).'' Local foods in port cities are hearty and delicious. (See Kushiro 
City in Kushiro sub-prefecture and Nemuro City in Nemuro sub-prefecture for 
port cities' foods.)

   Nanae [na-na-e] [\u4E03\u98EF] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, south 
Hokkaidou (Dou-nan). It is an inland town. The Kunebetsu River flows south and 
empties into Hakodate Bay. Mt. Komagatake (1131 meters, volcano) rises to the 
north. Lake Oonuma is located at the foot of Mt. Komagatake. Lake Oonuma and 
Mt. Komagatake are designated as a quasi national park.
   The name Nanae derived from the Ainu word naa-nay (many, stream) or nam-nay 
(cold, stream). Both words referred Nanae-hama beach along Hakodate Bay, which 
belongs to Hokuto City now.
   Before the Edo era, Mishima Shrine was built in 1532. A shrine was built in 
a Japanese village. In the Edo era (from the 17th to the 19th centuries), 
Nanae [\u4E03\u91CD] was a Japanese village ruled by the Matsumae Domain. After 
the Meiji period, in 1870 (Meiji 3), Nanae Kan-en (a government farm) was built 
by the Hokkaidou Development Commission. An American advisor Edwin Dun 
instructed Western-style farming at the government farm such as dairy farming 
and butter production. In 1879 (Meiji 12), an administrative office (kochou-
yakuba) of Nanae [\u4E03\u98EF] was established by the merger of Nanae and 
Iida [\u98EF\u7530] villages. In the same year, an administrative office of 
Oonakayama [\u5927\u4E2D\u5C71] was established by the merger of Ookawa 
[\u5927\u5DDD] and Nakajima [\u4E2D\u5CF6] villages. In 1885 (Meiji 18), Nanae 
village merged Oonakayama's village. 
   In 1902 (Meiji 35), Nanae Village (2nd-class municipality) was established. 
(See the note of Matsumae in Oshima sub-prefecture for 1st-class and 2nd-class 
municipalities). In the same year, Nanae Station on Hokkaidou Railway (now 
Hakodate Main Line) opened. In 1907 (Meiji 40), Nanae Village (1st-class 
municipality) was established. In 1957 (Shouwa 32), Nanae Town was established.
#1 #2
   Nanae's town hall and the center of the town are located on the south of the 
Hakodate Plain (the part is called Oono Plain). National Route 5 (Oonuma-
kokudou) and the Hakodate Main Line run through the plain. The row of red pine 
trees (Akamatsu) along National Route 5 is designated as one of the 100 Roads 
of Japan. The south part of the town, including Oonakayama Station, is an urban 
area that continues from Hakodate City. The population of Nanae increased. It 
is the second largest town (machi) in Hokkaidou after Otofuke Town in Tokachi. 
#3 #4 #5
   Distinctive industries of Nanae are manufacturing, agriculture, dairy 
farming, and sightseeing. The main manufacturing products are soft drinks 
(including Guarana [Guaran\u00E1]), wine, and semiconductors. FAMING = pasture 
669 hectares in 2015, paddy rice 400, fodder 280, carrots 210, green onions 
114, radishes 89, orchards 60, flowers 22 (carnations and other flowers), 
spinach 18, beans (soybeans 9, adzuki beans 4, other beans 4), tomatoes 11, 
cabbage 8, cucumbers 8, onions 3, broccoli 3, apples X (concealed), other 
vegetables 91+X (sweet corn, pumpkins, asparagus), other grains 3; dairy cows 
1988 head in 2015, and hens 128,000. #6
   As for sightseeing, Oonuma has been designated as one of the New Three 
Scenic Views of Japan. Niyama Ski Ground is located next to Niyama Station. #7

   #1 As for Nanae Governmental Farm, in 1863, near the end of the Edo era, the 
Gaertner brothers from Prussia rented the land and started Western-style 
farming. The area was 990 hectares (twice as large as Hokkaidou University's 
ranch in Shizunai). 
  In addition to their trade and consular duties, the Gaertner brothers 
cultivated apples, pears, gooseberries, cherries, and vegetables. That was the 
first time in Japan that Western apples were cultivated. The Gaertner brothers 
also taught Western-style farming to neighboring farmers.
   They sold food to foreign ships in the Port of Hakodate, which was opened in 
1854. There are no photographs or paintings of the brothers. Their appearance 
is unknown.
   The Gaertner brothers planted beech trees. The trees became a forest 
along National Route 5. Beech forest was used for grazing pigs in Germany 
(Prussia). The meat of the wild boars that ate acorns is good.
   In 1870 (Meiji 3), the Gaertners brothers' farm was closed and Nanae 
Government Farm (Nanae-kan-en) opened on the site. The Meiji government bought 
the land back. To start Western-style farming in Hokkaidou, the government 
established five experiment farms in Tokyo and Hokkaidou. In Tokyo, there were
Aoyama and Azabu farms. In Hokkaidou, there were Nanae, Sapporo, and Nemuro 
farms. Nanae was the largest one. 
   An English writer Isabella Lucy Bird visited the government farm in 1878. 
She reported the scenery like this; The farm was like a Western country. It 
had Western-style buildings such as animal stables, a large watermill, and a 
butter factory. (See Mori Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the English 
writer). 
   In 1882, the Hokkaidou Development Commission was abolished. After that, 
Nanae Government Farm was gradually sold off and closed in 1894. Only the 
stone wall of the farm remains near Nanae Elementary School.
   #2 Nanae Town belongs to Kameda county. The name Kame-da is Japanese. It 
means ``turtle, paddy field.'' It is a good-luck name. (See the note of 
Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for Kameda).
   #3 Mt. Nanae (779 m) rises near the center of the town. The night view of 
the downtown of Hakodate from Mt. Nanae is called Hakodate-ura-yakei (another 
side of Hakodate night view).
   #4 Oonuma Station on the Hakodate Main Line is the junction between Oonuma 
main route and Sawara branch route. (See Mori Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 
the branch route.) There is another branch route to the south between Oonuma 
and Nanae stations. It was constructed by the Japanese National Railways in 
1966 to increase transport capacity. It was before motorization. (When I read 
``The Grapes of Wrath'' (a novel), I found that motorization and agricultural 
mechanization in the USA started half a century earlier than Japan.)
   #5 The large red pine trees along National Route 5 remind me of old trails 
in Honshuu island. The pine trees were transplanted from Goryoukaku [go-ryou-
kaku] Castle to the roadside in 1876 (Meiji 9). It was to make a scenic road 
before Emperor Meiji visited Nanae Government Farm.
   #6 Guarana [Guaran\u00E1] is a popular drink in Brazil. It is like Coca-
Cola. Guarana is made from red berries of Guarana which is native to the Amazon 
region.
  After the war, Coca-Cola became popular in Honshuu island. Before the 
American product landed in Hokkaidou island, a company in Nanane started to 
produce and sell Guarana. It is still popular in Hokkaidou.
   The Japanese pronounce Guarana as ``ga-ra-na.'' It is like English. In the 
original place, Brazilians pronounce it like ``gu-a-ra-na.'' It is like Latin. 
   I ordered Guarana in a jet plane in Brazil. I said ``Ah, ga-ra-na,'' and 
the stewardess gave me a bottle of water. It may have sounded ``Agua, ne?'' 
[\u00C1gua, n\u00E9?] (Water, OK?). (See Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture 
for local foods.) 
   #7 New Three Scenic Views of Japan are Mihono-matsubara in Shizuoka 
Prefecture (Honshuu island), Yabakei in Ooita Prefecture (Kyuushuu island), and 
Oonuma in Hokkaidou Prefecture (Hokkaidou island). They were selected in 1915 
(Taishou 4). They are not new now. The Japanese like putting ``new'' to things. 
   The original Three Scenic Views are located in Honshuu island. They are 
Matsushima in Miyagi Prefecture (Pacific Ocean), Amano-hashidate in Kyouto 
Prefecture (the Sea of Japan), and Itsukushima in Hiroshima Prefecture (the 
Seto Inland Sea). They were selected in 1643. It was in the Edo era ruled 
by the Tokugawa Shogunate.
   #8 Oonuma Quasi National Park includes Lake Oonuma, Lake Konuma, and Lake 
Junsai. The shapes of the lakes were formed by the eruption of Mt. Komagatake 
in 1640.
   In Lake Oonuma, sweet fish and shrimp are caught. In Lake Junsai, Junsai 
(watershield) can be harvested. 
   In the end of the Edo era, Lake Oonuma was opened to foreigners for walking. 
   In the Meiji period, an ice factory started operation on the shore of Lake 
Oonuma. The company cut ice blocks from Lake Oonuma in winter, store them, and 
shipped them from Hakodate to Tokyo in summer (by Professor Katsuhiko Yamashita 
at the Meeting of Hokkaidou Geographical Society in 2014). Ice was very 
expensive in the summer 150 years ago. 
   After the 1960s, villas were developed on the slope from Lake Oonuma to Mt. 
Komagatake. Aerial photographs show roundabouts (rotaries) and ``culs de sac'' 
in the area. (See Otaru City in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for roundabouts.)
   #9 This is a legend about Lake Oonuma and Mt. Komagatake; ``Masatane Aihara 
was the load of Oodate fort in the 15th century. It was located in today's 
Matsumae Town. Aihara came to Ezo (old Hokkaidou) with Masasue Andou (his 
lord), Kakizaki Sueshige, and Nobuhiro Takeda, who later succeeded the Kakizaki 
clan.
   Masatane Aihara came into conflict with the Kakizaki clan. He was defeated 
and fled to Lake Oonuma. He drowned himself in to the lake. Later, the Kakizaki 
clan became the lord of the Matsumae domain in the Edo era (from the 17th to 
the 19th centuries).
   Even in the Edo era, Masatane Aihara's horse was seen several times near 
Lake Oonuma. The horse had a very long mane that reached on the ground.''
   This legend said that the name of Mt. Komagatake signifies the Aihara's  
ghost horse. Mt. Koma-ga-take means ``horse, of, mountain'' in Japanese, though 
it is commonly said that the shape of the mountain looks like a horse.
   The legend of Aihara is similar to the legend of Yoshitsune Minamoto, who 
was defeated by Yoritomo Minamoto, the founder of the Kamakura Shogunate. The 
Japanese feel sympahty for tragic heroes. The tendency is called Hangan-biiki 
(Hougan-biiki) in Japanese. ``Hangan'' means the job position of Yoshitsune 
Minamoto, and ``biiki'' means sympathy. (See Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-
prefecture for the old 12 forts established by the Andou clan; See Biratori 
Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture for Yoshitsune legend; See Niikappu Town in 
Hidaka sub-prefecture for Hangan-date Rock.)

AREA 111 KM2 (2010), FOREST 90, CULTIVATED 1; KAYABE [\u8305\u90E8] COUNTY; POP 
4767 (2010), 4979 (1990); COUNTRY SIGN = GEYSER, PUMICE, & MOUNTAIN.

   Shikabe [shi-ka-be] [\u9E7F\u90E8] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, south 
Hokkaidou (Dou-nan). The rivers of Honbetsu, Shikabe, Orito, and Tokoro flow to 
the Pacific Ocean. The Orito River flows from Lake Oonuma in Oonuma Quasi 
National Park. (See Nanae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for lake Oonuma.) Mt. 
Komagatake (1131 meters, volcano) stands to the north. It erupted in 1929. Huge 
amounts of pumice were piled up.
   The name Shikabe came from the Ainu word sikerpe (Amur cork tree; ``Kihada'' 
in Japanese) or sike-un-pe (carry, it, place). The latter means a place where a 
mountain stood in the landscape or a place where the Ainu got off their boats 
and carry their luggage. Both signified the mouth of the Shikabe River. #1
   As for history, in 1666, during the Edo era, a hot spring was discovered by 
Gengorou Itou from Tsugaru (now Aomori Prefecture). He saw a deer (shika) 
healing its wounds in a hot spring. It is the origin of the current Shikabe Hot 
Spring. In the Edo era, fishermen emigrated.
   After the Meiji period, in 1879 (Meiji 12), an administrative office 
(kochou-yakuba) of Shikabe village was established. In 1906 (Meiji 39), Shikabe 
Village (2nd-class municipality) was established. (See the note of Matsumae 
Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.) In 
1983 (Shouwa 58), Shikabe Town was established.
   Shikabe's town hall and the center of the town are located near the mouth of 
the Shikabe River. National Route 278 (Esan-kokudou) runs there. At the foot of 
Mt. Komagatake, along the Pacific coast, Sawara branch route of the Hakodate 
Main Line runs. It detours the slope of Mt. Komagatake inland.
   Distinctive industries of Shikabe are fishery and tourism. FARMING; pasture 
52 hectares in 2015, fodder 16; and dairy cows - (zero). FISHERY; walleye 
pollock 4165 tons in 2017, sardines 701, octopus 401, shellfish 327 (including 
scallops), mackerel 146, squid (flying squid 134, other squid 8), right-eye 
flounder 125, yellowtail 95, Konbu kelp 89, salmon 75, Pacific cod 55, sea 
urchins 47, tuna 11, atka mackerel 7, Hatahata 7, olive flounder 4, 
shrimp/prawns 4, herring 4, kichiji 4, trout 3, horse mackerel 2, other fish 
108+X, and other marine animals 62. Fishing ports are located in Shikabe, 
Honbetsu, and Dekima districts.
   As for sightseeing, vacation homes, golf courses, and a resort hotel are 
located near Shikabe Station (the station is far from the center of the town). 
Shikabe Roadside Station on National Route 278 is part of Shikabe Hot Spring. A 
15-meter high geyser gushes from the hot spring. #2

   #1 As for the name Shikabe, which means sikerpe (Amur cork tree) in Ainu, 
Amur cork tree was used as a yellow dye and an intestinal medicine. Amur cork 
tree is called Ki-hada in Japanese, which means ``yellow, skin.''
   There are large Kihada trees at the central lawn of Hokkaidou University. In 
2018, during Typhoon No. 21, the large branches were fell down. The yellow 
of the tree stood out.
   The Ainu make Inau (ritual stick) from a branch of Kihada, Yanagi (willow), 
Mizuki (dogwood), and Enju (pagoda tree). The Ainu believe the trees have good 
spirits.
   Ainu's ritual sticks are located in the Forest of Archaeological Site in 
Hokkaidou University. They look like dread hair. (See Abashiri City in Okhotsk 
sub-prefecture for Enju tree; See Biratori Town in Hidaka for Ainu culture.)
    Cf. the Japanese make ritual sticks from Sakaki (broad-leaved evergreen 
tree). (See Nihei lab (2023) for Sakaki tree). 
   #2 As for Shiakbe Station, in the past, the name was Takamachi Station. This 
is because there used to be another Shikabe Station on the Oonuma-dentetsu 
Line. The railroad ran along the Orito River from 1929 to 1952. ``Takamachi'' 
means hawk catchers in Japanese. There were hawk catchers in Shikabe in the Edo 
era. They caught hawks and falcons. (See Shiriuchi Town in Oshima sub-
prefecture for falconry).

   Mori [mo-ri] [\u68EE] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, south Hokkaidou 
(Dou-nan). The area faces Uchiura Bay (Volcano Bay). The rivers of Nigorikawa, 
Torizaki, and Oshironai flow. Mt. Komagatake (1131 meters, volcano) rises to 
the south. The area was newly established by the merger of Mori Town and Sawara 
Town in 2005. #2
   The name Mori means ``forest'' in Japanese. The original name was Oniushi, 
which was derived from the Ainu word o-ni-us-pet (river mouth, tree, many, 
river). It signified the Torizaki River or the Mori River.
   In the 16th century, the first Japanese immigrants came from Tsugaru (now 
Aomori Prefecture). In the Edo era, Kayabe-basho (a trading place) was 
established by the Matsumae Domain for herring fishing. Nigorikawa Hot Spring 
opened in 1805 in Nigorikawa Caldera. Villages of Washinoki, Mori, and 
Oshironai were established. (See Yoichi Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for 
herring fishing) #3
   The following is the history of Mori Town after the Meiji period. 
   Old Mori Town; In 1880 (Meiji 13), an administrative office (kochou-yakuba) 
was established in Washinoki [\u9DF2\u30CE\u6728] village. It covered villages 
of Ebiya [\u86EF\u8C37] and Ishikura [\u77F3\u5009]. In 1881 (Meiji 14), 
another administrative office was established in Mori village. It covered 
villages of Oshironai [\u5C3E\u767D\u5185] and Shukunobe [\u5BBF\u91CE\u8FBA]. 
In 1899 (Meiji 22), Mori village merged Washinoki village (this administrative 
office covered the six villages). In 1902 (Meiji 35), Mori Village (2nd-class 
municipality) was established. In 1903 (Meiji 36), Mori Station on Hokkaidou 
Railway (now Hakodate Main Line) opened. In 1907 (Meiji 40), Mori Village (1st-
class municipality) was established. (See the note of Matsumae Town in Oshima 
sub-prefecture for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.) In 1902 (Taishou 
10), Mori Town was established. #4 
   Old Sawara Town; In 1880 (Meiji 13), an administrative office (kochou-
yakuba) was established in Sawara [\u7802\u539F] village. It covered Kakeruma 
[\u639B\u6F97] village. In 1906 (Meiji 39), Sawara Village (2nd-class 
municipality) was established. In 1927 (Shouwa 2), Sawara Station on Oshima-
kaigan-tetsudou (Oshima coastal railway) opened (now the Sawara branch route of 
the Hakodate Main Line). In 1970 (Shouwa 45), Sawara Town was established.
   Mori's town hall is located near the mouths of Torizaki and Mori rivers. 
National Route 5 (Oonuma-kokudou) and National Route 278 (Esan-kokudou) branch 
off near the town hall. National Route 278 runs along Uchiura Bay. Mori Station 
on the Hakodate Main Line is the junction of Oonuma route (main route) and 
Sawara branch route. Heavy freight [fu-rei'-t] trains use the branch route 
along the bay. #5 #6
   Distinctive industries in Mori are fishery, agriculture, animal husbandry, 
food processing, and geothermal power generation. FARMING; pasture 471 
hectares in 2015, beans (soybeans 184, adzuki beans 101, other beans 15), 
potatoes 225, paddy rice 207, sugar beets 119, wheat 69, radishes 50, fodder 
42, broccoli 27, flowers 6, orchards 5, watermelons 1, other vegetables 514+X 
(pumpkins, sweet corn, etc.), tomatoes X (concealed); hogs and pigs 73,493 head 
in 2015 (the largest in Hokkaidou), dairy cows 238, and hens 12,000.
   FISHERY; sardines 7668 tons in 2017, walleye pollock 3251, right-eye 
flounder 1328, squid (flying squid 726, other squid 14), mackerel 578, 
shellfish (scallops 161 [cultured], other shellfish 198), octopus 254, salmon 
242, shrimp/prawns 169 (including Botan shrimp), Konbu kelp 164, yellowtail 
126, sand lance 71, crabs (snow crabs 44, other crabs 26), herring 68, anchovy

puffer fish 6, olive flounder 5, atka mackerel 3, trout 2, Kichiji 2, Hatahata 
2, congers 1, marine mammals 2, other fish 481, and other marine animals 66. #7
   At Nigorikawa district in Mori Town, farmers grow Onsen Tomato (hot-spring 
tomatoes). They grow tomatoes in greenhouses that are heated with hot spring 
water. (See Biratori Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture for tomato production).
   As for sightseeing, Mori Station is the birth place of Ika-meshi (squid 
rice). Squid rice became famous all over the country for department stores' 
station-lunch festivals. There used to be many department stores in front of 
large stations. #8 #9

   #1 Mori Town belongs to Kayabe county (Kayabe-gun). Kayabe was named after 
the Ainu word kaya-un-pe (sail, exist, place). It signified Mt. Komagatake. The 
Ainu viewed the shape of the mountain as a sailing ship. (See Nanae Town in 
Oshima sub-prefecture for Mt. Komagatake.)
   The Hazard Map of Komagatake Volcano was published in 1983. The map included 
towns of Mori, Shikabe, and Nanae. It was the first volcano hazard map in the 
country. Currently, each municipality publishes own hazard map. Who makes 
hazard maps? The answer is consulting companies. They are the main employers of 
graduates of the faculty of geology and geography (by K. Mannen 2020 
``Volcanoes as seen from cutting-edge science'' [written in Japanese]). Many of 
my classmates work for consulting companies.
   #2 The pronunciation of Mori Town in Japanese is Mori-machi. Other towns in 
Hokkaidou are pronounced ``-chou,'' for example, Kayabe-chou and Yakumo-chou. 
The municipality decides the pronunciation. It is said that ``-machi'' is 
located mainly in eastern Japan and ``-chou'' is mainly in western Japan. 
According to the book ``Mori-machi-shi (Mori Town history),'' the town hall 
surveyed the reason in the 1980s but could not find the answer. (Cf. the former 
Ishikari 10 towns in Ishikari City were mixture of ``-machi'' and ``-chou.'' 
See Ishikari City in Ishikari sub-prefecture.) 
   The name Torizaki was derived from Torii (shrine gate) in Japanese. There 
was a shrine that had many Torii gates in the forest. The place was called 
Torii-ga-saki (shraine gate, of, cape). On the map published by Takeshirou 
Matsuura in 1859 (http://koukita.github.io/touzaiezo/map/), the river is 
written as Torisaki-kawa (Torisaki River). (See Setana Town in Hiyama sub-
prefecture for Japanese river names.) 
   #3 According to the book ``Sawara-chou-shi (Sawara Town history)'' published 
in 2000, the first immigrants came from Kanita district in Tsugaru (now Aomori 
Prefecture) in 1532. 
   The name Sawara was derived from the Ainu word sar (reed) or sarki (reed); 
or the Japanese word sa-wara (sandy, field). The former Sawara Town has a long 
history and the origin of the name is unclear.
   #4 As for Washinoki district in Mori Town, at the beginning of the Meiji 
period, the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces landed on the coast of Washinoki. 
It was during the Boshin War.
   The commanding officers of the Tokugawa Shogunate were Takeaki Enomoto and 
Toshizou Hijikata. They were aboard the battleships Kaiyou and Kaiten.
   The landing took place on December 4th, 1868. On the day, a strong wind 
called Taba-kaze was blowing. (See Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture 
for Boshin War; See Easahi Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for local winds).
   #5 National Route 5 runs along the railway. The road connecting Hakodate and 
Sapporo was opened in 1873 (Meiji 6). At the time, the name was Sapporo-hondou 
(Sapporo Main Road). The road crossed Uchiura Bay (Volcano Bay) by boat from 
Mori to Muroran. 
   In 1878 (Meiji 11), the British author Isabella Lucy Bird stayed at an inn 
in Mori. She was traveling from Hakodate to Biratori to see Ainu culture. She 
documented Mori like this, ``Mori is a large village in the south of Volcano 
Bay, however, the houses are about to collapse at any moment.'' But she liked 
the view from the inn. (See Nanae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture, Toyoura Town 
in Iburi sub-prefecture, and Biratori Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture for the 
British author.)
   #6 The Sawara branch route of the Hakodate Main Line connects Mori and 
Oonuma stations via the former Shikabe Town. During World War II, the branch 
route was constructed to increase transportation capacity. It utilized these 
existing railroads, Oshima-kaigan-tetsudou (Oshima Coastal Railway) and Oonuma-
dentetsu (Oonuma Electric Railway). In June 1945, the branch route opened. In 
August 1945, Japan surrendered.
   #7 As for animal husbandry in Mori, there are swine farms managed by NH 
Foods (Nippon Ham). The company's processing plant is located in neighboring 
Yakumo Town.
   As for food processing in Mori, Nichirei Foods produces croquettes and 
minced cutlets. Maruha Nichiro produces salmon flakes and minced chicken.
   In the garden of Nichirei Foods, there is a monument that commemorates the 
birth place of frozen food in Japan. Nichirei Foods started frozen food 
business in 1920 (Taishou 9) using a charcoal gas engine. The technology was 
imported from the USA. The company sold frozen fish in Tokyo.
   As for frozen food, the first refrigerator was sold by GE (General Electric) 
in the USA. It was in the 1920s. Japanese companies produced a lot of 
refrigeratos after the 1960s. My parents used a Hitachi refrigerator for more 
than 50 years. The next one was broken in two years. A never broken 
refrigerator is not good for a company today.
   #8 As for power generation in Mori, Hokkaidou Electric Power operates a 
geothermal power plant on the slope of Nigorikawa caldera. Geothermal power 
generation is suitable in the volcanic island. It has no fuel costs. These are 
disadvantages however; 1) The output is small compared to the large size of 
the building, 2) The cost of construction is high, and 3) Many volcanoes are 
located in national parks and the nature conservation laws restrict 
construction.
   #9 Abe Shouten (Abe Store) started to sell Ika-meshi (squid rice) at Mori 
Station in 1941. It was during World War II.
   All trains stopped at Mori Station because it was a junction with Oshima 
Coastal Railway (Oshima-kaigan-tetsudou). Squid rice became popular among young 
soldiers who stationed in Hokkaidou.
   At the time, the catch of flying squid was good. Squid rice can be cooked 
with a small amount of rice. During the war, the distribution of rice was 
controlled.
   There are a variety of squid rice from other companies. Abe Store's squid 
rice became vacuum packed in 2016. Souvenir shops at Sapporo Station and New 
Chitose Airport started selling the original squid rice.
   Previously, the expiry date of the original squid rice was one day, so it 
was sold through demonstration sales at department stores. Incidentally, squid-
shaped potteries of 4000-year-old were excavated in Mori Town in 2002.

   Yakumo [ya-ku-mo] [\u516B\u96F2] is a town in Oshima sub-prefecture, south 
Hokkaidou (Dou-nan). The area crosses the narrow part of Oshima Peninsula. It 
faces Uchiura Bay (Funka-wan) and the Sea of Japan (``Funka-wan'' is a 
translation of Volcano Bay into Japanese; See Oshima sub-prefecture for the 
bay).
   The area of Yakumo was newly formed by the merger of Yakumo Town and 
Kumaishi Town in 2005. The former Yakumo Town was located along Uchiura Bay on 
the Pacific Ocean side. The former Kumaishi Town was located along the Sea of 
Japan. With the merger, Futami county was newly established. The name Futami 
means ``two seas'' in Japanese.
   The name Yakumo is Japanese. It was named by Yoshikatsu Tokugawa, who was 
the founder of Tokugawa Farm in the former Yakumo Town. Yakumo means 
``overlapping clouds.'' He quoted the name from the oldest Japanese poem. 
Tokugawa Farm was the birthplace of these traditional souvenirs from Hokkaidou; 
butter candy and carved wooden bear (a carved wooden bear with a salmon in its 
mouth).
   The name Kumaishi was derived from the Ainu word kuma-us-i (fish drying 
site, many, place). The Japanese characters Kumaishi [\u718A\u77F3] mean 
``bear, stone.'' #1 
   As for history in Yakumo, in the early Edo era, the Matsumae Domain run a 
fort (ban-sho) in Kumaishi. It was the northern end of Japanese territory. 
Along the Uchiura Bay, there were trading places (basho) in Nodaoi 
[\u91CE\u7530\u8FFD] and Yuurappu.
   In the mid Edo era, the Matsmae Domain built a fort in Yamukushinai (later 
Yamakoshinai [\u5C71\u8D8A\u5185]). It became the northern end of Japanese 
territory in the Pacific Ocean side. Then, the central village was moved from 
Nodaoi to neighboring Otoshibe [\u843D\u90E8] due to an increase in fishing 
immigrants. Then, the trading post Yuurappu was renamed Yamakoshinai. 
  The following is the history of Yakumo Town after the Meiji period.
  Old Yakumo Town; In 1872 (Meiji 5), Yamakoshinai office of the Hokkaidou 
Development Commission was established. In 1879 (Meiji 12), administrative 
offices (kochou-yakuba) were established in Yamakoshinai and Otoshibe villages.
In 1890 (Meiji 23), the administrative office of Yamakoshinai village was moved 
to Yakumo village. In 1902 (Meiji 35), Yakumo Village (2nd-class municipality) 
was established. (See the note of Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 
1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.) In 1903 (Meiji 22), Yamakoshinai 
Station and Yakumo Station on Hokkaidou Railway (now Hakodate Main Line) 
opened. In 1907 (Meiji 40), Yakumo Village (1st-class municipality) was 
established. In 1915 (Taishou 4), Otoshibe Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established. In 1919 (Taishou 8), Yakumo Town was established. In 1957 (Shouwa 
32), Yakumo Town merged Otoshibe Village.
   Old Kumaishi Town; In 1973 (Meiji 6), administrative offices (kochou-yakuba) 
were established in Kumaishi, Ainumanai [\u76F8\u6CBC\u5185], and Tomarikawa 
[\u6CCA\u5DDD]. Those were a continuation of village chiefs from the Edo era. 
In 1902 (Meiji 35), the three villages were merged and Kumaishi Village (2nd-
class municipalities) was established. In 1962 (Shouwa 37), Kumaishi Town was 
established. Herring fishing flourished in Kumaishi from the Edo era to the 
Meiji period. The peak of Kumaishi's population was 10,049 in 1962 (Shouwa 37).
   Yakumo's town hall is located near the mouth of the Yuurappu River. It was 
the former Yakumo's town hall. National Route 5 (Oonuma-kokudou) and National 
Route 277 (Unseki-kokudou) branch off near the town hall. The Hakodate Main 
Line runs along Uchiura Bay. The name Yuurappu was derived from the Ainu 
word yu-rap (hot spring, down). It is an old name before Yakumo. #2
   Distinctive industries of Yakumo are animal husbandry, agriculture, fishery, 
and meat processing. FARMIMG; pasture 4360 hectares in 2015, fodder 989, paddy 
rice 338, potatoes 90 (including seed potatoes), adzuki beans 67, soybeans 51, 
green onions 20 (mainly Nanpaku-negi), flowers 3, spinach 1, tomatoes 1, other 
vegetables 95+X (pumpkins and sweet corn), other grains 11; dairy cows 9111 
head in 2015, beef cattle 4893, and hens 18,000.
   FISHERY; right-eye flounder 642 tons in 2017, salmon 403, squid (flying 
squid 248, other squid 1), Konbu kelp 178, walleye pollock 156, shellfish 144, 
shrimp/prawns 81, octopus 66, yellowtail 52, crabs (snow crabs 22, other crabs 
16), herring 21, olive flounder 20, Pacific cod 19, sea urchins 18, mackerel 
16, atka mackerel 15, sharks 9, trout 7, walleye pollock 4, Hatahata 3, other 
fish 236, and other marine animals 118. #3
   As for meat processing in Yakumo, Japan Food Packer Dounan Factory (Nippon 
Ham Group) processes pork and beef. There was also a Kentucky Fried Chicken 
experiment farm, which is now a tourist farm. #4
   As for sightseeing, Yakumo Hot Spring and Ken-ichi Hot Spring are located 
along National Route 277. Guinkon-yu Hot Spring is located along the Otoshibe 
River. The name Guinkon means silver-wedding-anniversary in Japanese. In the 
former Kumaishi Town, Abalone Festival is held in late May. When I passed by 
the festival, a lot of cars gathered and the police guided them. #5

   #1 Yoshikatsu Tokugawa asked land granting for the former samurais of the 
Owari Domain (today's Aichi Prefecture). It was approved and Tokugawa farm was 
established in Yuurappu district in Yamakoshinai village. When Yuurappu was 
separated from Yamakoshinai village in 1881 (Meiji 14), Yoshikatsu Tokugawa 
named the new village Yakumo. It was named after the oldest poem in the 
country. The lyrics are as follows;
   Yakumo-tatsu izumo-yaegaki tsumagomi-ni yaegaki-tsukuru sono-yaegaki-wo
   (Overlapping clouds stand, fences within fences in Izumo, to live with my 
    wife, make fences within fences, the fences within fences) 
   It is said that the poem was read by Susanoo-no-mikoto (a god of mythology). 
The lyrics are mysterious. It was sung for weddings.
   Tokugawa Farm introduced Western-style agriculture such as dairy farming. 
The farm also made butter candy and wooden bears (souvenirs from Hokkaidou). 
The prototype of the wooden bear was a carved wooden bear from Switzerland. 
Yoshichika Tokugawa visited Europa and bought it in 1922. Later, making carved 
wooden bears became a winter job by farmers. Tokugawa Farm was demolished after 
World War II. The Allied Powers (US Army) ordered land reform in the country.
   #2 As for roads in Yakumo, National Route 277 crosses Unseki Pass and 
reaches Kumaishi. The name Unseki means ``cloud, stone'' in Japanese. It is a 
combination of Kanji characters for Yakumo and Kumaishi.
   The town hall of the former Kumaishi Town was located along National Route 
299 (Hiyama-kokudou) on the Sea of Japan side. It takes about an hour by car to 
visit the current Yakumo's town hall. There were many reasons for the merger 
beyond the border between sub-prefectures.
   #3 As for agriculture in Yakumo, during the Taishou period (1910s and 
1920s), farmers cultivated mainly potatoes. Potatoes were processed into potato 
starch, and potato starch was exported to abroad. Exports of potato starch 
declined due to the Great Depression, and dairy farming increased after the 
1930. Today, Yakumo Town is the largest dairy farming region in south 
Hokkaidou.
   The main breed of dairy cow is Holstein. It is the largest breed among cows 
and cattle (cows are for milk, cattle are for beef). Holstains are black and 
white cows. In Japanese, it is also called roppaku-gyuu (six-white cow) because 
there are six white spots around the nose. (See Eniwa City in Ishikari sub-
prefecture for dairy cows).
   As for fishery, the main catches in Uchiura Bay are farmed scallops, salmon, 
right-eye flounder, and farmed Konbu kelp, while the main catches in the Sea of 
Japan side are walleye cod, squid, and farmed abalone. Deep sea water is used 
for the abalone culture. Deep sea water is rich in minerals and low in 
bacteria.
   #4 As for chicken, I think it tastes better in Hokkaidou. Chickens may grow 
healthy without sweating under a cool climate. In Hokkaidou, fried chicken is 
called Zangui. The word may have come from Chinese.
   #5 As for meat processing in Yakumo, swine farms are located in the 
mountains of Mori and Imakane towns. Previously, Japanese Brazilians worked at 
the meat processing plant in Yakumo. There was a Brazilian restaurant in the 
town. 
   A teacher who instructed a brass band club at a local high school said; ``I 
sometimes went to the Brazilian restaurant. I liked the bossa nova live very 
much.''
   A student who played a musical instrument at University of Tsukuba also 
recommended Aguas de marco [\u00C1guas de mar\u00E7o] (Waters of March) from 
Rio de Janeiro.

   Oshamambe [o-sha-ma-n-be] [\u9577\u4E07\u90E8] is a town in Oshima sub-
prefecture, south Hokkaidou (Dou-nan). It is located in the root of the Oshima 
Peninsula. The area faces Uchiura Bay. The rivers of Oshamambe, Monbetsu, and 
Kun-nui flow. #1 #2 #3
   The name Oshamambe was derived from the Ainu word o-samam-pet (river mouth, 
bend, river) or o-samampe (river mouth, flatfish).
   In 1669, during the Edo era, the Ainu forces led by Shakushain advanced from 
Hidaka to Matsumae. At the Kun-nui River, they were defeated by gun corps of 
the Matsumae Domain. In 1773, the Matsumae Domain built a guardhouse and Inari 
Shrine there (incidentally, in 2022, water gushed out from the shrine's 
grounds up to a height of 30 meters). In the end of the Edo era, fishing 
villages of Yamakoshinai and Oshamambe were established. They were included in 
Yuurappu Basho, a trading place manged by the Matsumae Domain. Yuurappu and 
Yamakoshinai were located in today's Yakumo Town. Then, the trading post 
Yuurappu was renamed Yamakoshinai. In 1864, the trading post Yamakoshinai was 
abolished, and villages of Yamakoshinai (today's Yakumo Town) and Oshamambe 
were established. #4
   After the Meiji period, in 1872 (Meiji 5), Oshamambe office of Hakkaidou 
Development Commission was established. In 1873 (Meiji 6), a village chief 
(kochou) was appointed. It was a continuation of village chief system from the 
Edo era. In 1903 (Meiji 36), Oshamambe Station on Hokkaidou Railway (now 
Hakodate Main Line) opened. In 1906 (Meiji 39), Oshamambe Village (2nd-class 
municipality) was established. (See the note of Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-
prefecture for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities). In 1923 (Taishou 12), 
Oshamambe Village (1st-class municipality) was established, and Nagawa Line 
(now Muroran Main Line) opened, and Oshamambe became a junction. In 1943 
(Shouwa 18), Oshamambe Town was established.
   The town hall of Oshamambe and the center of the town are located near the 
mouth of the Oshamambe River. National Route 5 (Oonuma-kokudou or Youtei-
kokudou) and the Hakodate Main Line pass the center of the town. National Route 
37 (Shizukari-kokudou) and the Muroran Main Line branch off there. Shizukari 
Pass and Rebungue Pass to the west are steep sea cliffs, so the old road and 
railroad to Sapporo went inland from Oshamambe. They were today's National 
Route 5 and the Hakodate Main Line. #5 #6
   Distinctive industries of Oshamambe are fishery and dairy farming. FARMING;
pasture 1412 hectares in 2015, fodder 239; and dairy cows 2224 head in 2015. 
FISHERY; salmon 386 tons in 2017, shellfish 107 (mainly farmed scallop), right-
eye flounder 93, yellowtail 27, sea urchins 20, walleye pollock 17, crabs 10 
(including horsehair crabs), olive flounder 13, flying squid 8, tuna 2, 
mackerel 1, octopus 1, seaweed 1, herring - (zero), other fish 38, and other 
marine animals 17.
   Fishing ports are located in Shizukari, Oshamambe, Oonaka, and Kun-nui. 
Crabs are the specialty of the town. The lunch box of Oshamambe Station is 
Kani-meshi (crab rice). #7

   #1 Oshima Peninsula is located in the south part of Hokkaidou. The location 
is below (south) a line connecting Oshamambe, Kuromatsunai Basin, and Suttsu 
Bay.
   As for the Oshamambe River, natural gas is extracted in the lower reaches of 
the river. In the upper reaches of the river, there is Futamata Radium Hot 
Spring. It is a secluded hot spring. 
   As for the Kunnui River, the name came from the Ainu word Kunne-nay (black, 
river). The river was black because it contained iron sand. Previously, the 
iron sand collected in Oshamambe and Yakumo was shipped to Muroran to make 
steel. (See Kyougoku Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for iron mine).
   #2 These are rivers that have funny names in Oshamambe; The Kyuushi-battari 
River, which sounds like ``sudden death river'' in Japanese. The Warui River, 
which means ``bad river'' in Japanese. It was named bad because salmons did not 
appear in autumn and timbers could not be streamed (by H. Nagata 1891 
``Hokkaidou-ezo-go-chimei-kai (Explanation of Ezo language in Hokkaidou''). Cf. 
the name Enbetsu in Rumoi sub-prefecture has the same meaning. It came from the 
Ainu word wen-pet (bad, river). It was bad because there were few salmon. Dried 
salmon was important food for the Ainu to spend a long winter.
   These are other rivers who have funny names in Hokkaidou;
   1) The Yarikirenai River in Yuni Town, Sorachi sub-prefecture, which sounds 
``I can't stand any more!-river'' in Japanese. The name came from the Ainu word 
yanke-nai (no fish, stream).
   2) The Obake River in Urakawa Town, Hidaka sub-prefecture. It means ``ghost 
river'' in Japanese. It is said that ghosts appeared along the river in winter. 
Usually, ghosts appear in summer in Japan. (See Urakawa Town). 
   3) The Osaru River in Date City, Iburi sub-prefecture. It sounds ``a little 
monkey river'' in Japanese. It came from the Ainu word o-sar-pet (river mouth, 
reed, river). Ainu's houses were made of reeds. In the upstream of the Osaru 
River, there even is Niagara Falls. (See Date City).
   4) The Chiri-chiri River in Shiriuchi Town, Oshima sub-prefecture. It sounds 
``geography geography river'' or ``dust dust river'' in Japanese. The name came 
from the Ainu word chir-chir-nay (bird, bird, stream).
   5) The Doudoromappu River in Tsubetsu Town, Okhotsk sub-prefecture. It 
sounds like ``a muddy map river'' in Japanese. It came from the Ainu word tu-
utur-oma-p (two, together, enter, river).
   6) The Ponkikin River in Tsubetsu Town, Okhotsk sub-prefecture. In Google 
search, ``do you mean Ponkikki? (an old TV show).'' It came from the Ainu word 
pon-kikin (small, hackberry).
   7) The Kemichap River in Tsubetsu Town, Okhotsk sub-prefecture, which sounds 
like ``ketchap river.'' It came from the Ainu word kene-cha-p (alder, cut, 
river).
   8) The Bochi-no-sawa River in Oketo Town, Okhotsk sub-prefecture, which 
means ``the stream of cemetery'' in Japanese. 
   9) Gakkari-zawa in Otaru City, Shiribeshi sub-prefecture, which means 
``disappointment stream'' in Japanese. It was an old place name around 
Asarigawa Hot Spring. There were hopes and disappointments in the pioneer 
period.
   #3 As for typical river names in Ainu language, there are ``nay'' and ''pet 
(betsu in place names).'' Nay means a stream, whose course may change. Pet 
means a river, whose course is stable.
   As for typical Japanese river names in Hokkaidou, there are 54 ``Futamata-
gawa (bifurcation river)'' and 42 ``Futamata-zawa (bifurcation stream) 
according to Geospatial Information Authority Map (searched in March 2025). 
Things were simple in the past.
   #4 Shakushain was a chief of the Ainu. Before the revolt of Shakushain in 
1669, there were conflicts between Ainu chiefs. A rumor spread among the Ainu, `
``an Ainu messenger who attempted to borrow weapons from the Matsumae Domain 
was poisoned to death.'' Then, the Ainu chiefs banded together and rose up in 
many places. The Ainu forces attacked trading ships, gold dust diggers, and 
falcon catchers.
    The background to the revolt was the trade imbalance between the Ainu and 
the Japanese. The eruption of Mt. Tarumae in 1667 may have caused food 
shortages.
   #5 As for the population of Oshamambe, the percentage of residents aged 18 
to 19 is high, because there is Tokyo University of Science has Oshamambe 
campus. Students come in April and leave in February. The Oshamambe campus 
opened in 1987. It was during the bubble economy.
   As for the population in Hokkaidou, Hokkaidou University is like a water 
tower of population. It is a large university and students come from all over 
the country and from overseas. It has about 18,000 students. The number is 
larger than most towns and villages in Hokkaidou. (Cf. Tokyo Metropolitan 
University has about 8500).
   Undergraduate students live in Hokkaidou for four years and quite a number 
of them find jobs in Hokkaidou.
                                       *
   Before the 1980s, there were international students from Taiwan at 
University of Tsukuba where I studied. My teachers taught them. In the 1990s, 
our department had a field excursion to Taiwan. The former international 
students, at the time professors, were very kind to us. In the 2000s, I did not 
meet an international students from Taiwan, but there were many Korean 
students. Today, there are no international students from Korea in our 
department. Maybe they think there is nothing to learn from this small country 
(though many Taiwanese and Koreans visit Japan for sightseeing).
   I talked with a professor from Beijing in 2024. He said, ``Today, Chinese 
students also want to go the USA and European countries, but Japan is still 
popular because tuition fees are low.''
   Looking at the map of population density in Japan, Hokkaidou looks like a 
black continent (HTTP://MOOO.COM/NOTE/INTF1.JPG). Today, most of people live in 
large cities and their suburbs. A teacher who moved to Hokkaidou from the 
suburbs of Tokyo said that the house sold for more than he/she bought. City 
residents consume rather than produce. 
   #6 The eastern edge of Oshamambe town is Rebungue Pass. In the Edo era, 
Rebungue Pass was considered as one of the three most difficult passes in Ezo 
(old Hokkaidou) along with Saru Pass in Erimo TOWN (Hidaka sub-prefecture) and 
Raiden Pass in Iwanai TOWN (Shiribeshi sub-prefecture). (See Toyoura Town in 
Iburi sub-prefecture for Rebungue Pass.)
   #7 The shape of the Port of Kun-nui is like a wine grass. Fishing boats can 
be anchored far from shore. Kun-nui is located at the innermost part of Uchiura 
Bay. The tidal range is large. A long sandy beach appears at low tide. In the 
past, it was used difficult for fishing boats to leave the port at low tide.

   Kaminokuni [ka-mi-no-ku-ni] [\u4E0A\u30CE\u56FD] is a town in Hiyama sub-
prefecture, south Hokkaidou (Dou-nan). The area faces the Sea of Japan. Forests 
occupy 92% of the area. The Amanogawa River flows from Mt. Tongari. The 
Ishizaki River flows from Mt. Daisengen.
   The name Kaminokuni is Japanese. In the 15th century, the Andou clan in 
Tsugaru (now Aomori Prefecture) entered Ezo (now Hokkaidou Prefecture). They 
called the western part Kami-no-kuni, which means ``country, of, upper'' in 
Japanese and the eastern part ``Shimo-no-kuni, which means ``country, of, 
lower.'' The western part (upper) was near to their homeland. Shimo-no-kuni 
(lower) was located in today's Hokuto and Hakodate cities. The Andou clan also 
governed Kami-no-kuni and Shimo-no-kuni in their home land (now Aomori and 
Akita prefectures).
   As for history in Kaminokuni, in the early 13th century, the Andou clan in 
Tsugaru traded with the Ainu. They also managed exiles by the order of the 
Kamakura Shogunate. In the mid 15th century, the Nanbu clan advanced to 
Tsugaru, and Masasue Andou and his vassals escaped to Ezo. They build 12 forts 
in Ezo. In today's Kaminokuni Town, there were two forts; Hanazawa-date and 
Hiishi-date. Japanese settlements were built around the forts. Those were very 
old Japanese settlements in Ezo. (See Hakodate City and Nanae Town in Oshima 
sub-prefecture for the Andou clan's vassals; See Fukushima Town in Oshima sub-
prefecture for the oldest Japanese village).
   Koshamain's War occurred in 1457. Koshamain was an Ainu chief. Nobuhiro 
Takeda, who was one of the vassals of the Andou clan, ended the war. In the 
16th century, the main fort of Ezo moved from Kaminokuni to Matsumae. During 
the Edo era (from 17th to 19th century), Kaminokuni was governed by the 
Matsumae Domain. Kaminokuni was a village of temples, shrines, and fishing. #1 
#2 #3
   After the Meiji period, in 1872 (Meiji 5), administrative offices (kochou-
yakuba) were established in Kaminokuni and Shiofuki [\u6C50\u5439] villages. 
Those were a continuation of village chiefs from the Edo era. In 1879 (Meiji 
12), three administrative offices were established; one for the villages of 
Kaminokuni, Kita [\u5317], and Oodome [\u5927\u7559]; one for the villages of 
Shiofuki and Kinoko [\u6728\u30CE\u5B50]; and one for the villages of Ishizaki 
[\u77F3\u5D0E] and Chiisago [\u5C0F\u7802\u5B50]. In 1902 (Meiji 35), 
Kaminokuni Village (2nd-class municipality) was established (the seven 
villages were merged). In 1967 (Shouwa 42), Kaminokuni Town was established. 
(See the note of Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 1st-class and 2nd-
class municipalities).
   The town hall of Kaminokuni is located near the mouth of the Amanogawa 
River. National Route 228 (Matsumae-kokudou) runs along the sea. Previously, 
the Esashi Line ran along the valley of the Amanogawa River. It connected 
Esashi and Kikonai until 2014. The sites of the stations still remain (when I 
wrote this draft in 2019). There was also Amanogawa Station (Milky Way Station) 
for sightseeing. #4 #5
   Distinctive industries of Kaminokuni are fishing, paddy rice cultivation, 
and forestry. FARMING; paddy rice 239 hectares in 2015, beans (soybeans 74, 
adzuki beans 8, other beans 1), wheat 71, buckwheat 37, pasture 5, orchards 5, 
fodder 4, other vegetables 30+X (snow peas, asparagus, and Nira (Chinese chive 
or gynmigit)); and dairy cows X (concealed) in 2015.
   FISHERY; atka mackerel 130 tons in 2017, olive flounder 44, sea urchins 34, 
salmon 27, squid (flying squid 12, other squid 15), octopus 25, shrimp/prawns 
8, Pacific cod 7, shellfish (abalone 1, other shellfish 6), yellowtail 6, tuna 
6, right-eye flounder 5, sharks 4, mackerel 4, sardines 3, trout 1, herring 0, 
other fish 23, other marine animals 5. #6 #7
   As for sightseeing, Joukokuji Temple is the oldest building in Hokkaidou. 
The current building was built in 1758. Hanazawa fort was located on a hill 
near the center of the town. Windmills stand on the hill today. #8 #9

   #1 As for exiles in the early 13th century, thieves and pirates in the 
western country, including Kyouto, were taken to the eastern country (now 
Kantou region). After their trial, some of them were exiled to Ezo (now 
Hokkaidou region). 
   As for Hokkaidou explorers, Tadataka Inou (explored in 1800) and Takeshirou 
Matsuura (explored in 1845, 1846, 1849, 1856, 1857, and 1858) are famous, 
however, more than 500 years before them, the Japanese lived in what is now 
south Hokkaidou.
   #2 As for Koshamain's war, in 1456, an Ainu man asked a Japanese blacksmith 
to make a large knife (makiri). After the knife was made, the Ainu man 
quarreled over the quality and the price. The blacksmith got angry and stabbed 
the Ainu man to death with the knife. Then, the Ainu united under the chief 
Koshamain and attacked the Japanese in 1457. The Ainu forces destroyed 10 of 12 
forts (date); Shinori-date (in today's Hakodate City), Usukeshi-date (Hakodate 
City), Nakano-date (Kikonai Town), Wakimoto-date (Shiriuchi Town), Onnai-date 
(Fukushima Town), Oyobe-date (Matsumae Town), Oodate (Matsumae Town), Nebota-
date (Matsumae Town), Haraguchi-date (Matsumae Town), and Hiishi-date 
(Kaminokuni Town).
   The Japanese escaped to Hanazawa-date (in today's Kaminokuni Town) and 
Mobetsu-date (Hokuto City). In 1458, Nobuhiro Takeda shot Koshamain and his son 
to death with a bow. The Koshmain's war ended. However, the conflict between 
the Ainu and the Japanese continued. Mobetsu-date was also destroyed by the 
Ainu in 1508.
   #3 As for the history of Kaminokuni, after establishing 12 forts in Ezo, 
Andou Masasue returned to his home land and built Hiyama Castle, which was 
located in today's Noshiro City, Akita Prefecture. After Koshamain's War, 
Nobuhiro Takeda inherited the Kakizaki clan, one of the vassals of the Andou 
clan. He changed his family name from Takeda to Kakizaki. He built Katsuyama-
date (fort) next to Hanazawa-date.
   His son, Mitsuhiro Kakizaki, moved the fort to Matsumae, which became the 
capital of Ezo. His descendant founded Matsumae Domain in the Edo era. (See 
Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture).
   #4 The spelling of the Amanogawa River in Japanese is same as the Milky Way. 
In 1614, Geronimo de Angelis, a Jesuit missionary from Sicily island, was 
heading for Matsumae, but landed in Kaminokuni due to a heavy storm. Later, he 
drew an Ezo map and marked his landing point ``Tçuga (Tsuga).'' The old name 
of Kaminokuni was Tsuga [\u5929\u6CB3]. The pronunciation of the Kanji 
characters changed to Amanogawa [\u5929\u306E\u5DDD]. The old name Tsuga came 
from the Ainu word to-ka (pond, shore).
   #5 The built-up area of Kaminokuni is a lowland facing the sea. When 
Okushiri Earthquake occurred in July 1993, Kaminokuni's built-up area was very 
little damage by tidal waves, because Okushiri island between the epicenter and 
Kaminokuni acted as a shield. In Okushiri, more than 200 people died. (See 
Okushiri Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture.)
   #6 As for rice production in Kaminokuni, year 1993 was a crop failure due to 
cold weather. At the time, in Kaminokuni Town, where paddy rice cultivation was 
thriving, a crop-failure section was set up in the town hall.
   At the time, I was a university student and ate the Thai rice that was 
urgently imported. Japanese paddy rice production is like the ``just-in-time'' 
method of Toyota motors. Farmers and the government do not want to produce a 
surplus. (Cf. Ford Motor led the world first motorization by means of mass 
production.)
   #7 As for ``sansai'' (edible mountain plans) in Kaminokuni, on May 19, 2013, 
I traveled from Kikonai to Kaminokuni on a geography excursion. I saw many 
cars parked in the mountains of Kikonai for picking wild edible plants.
   People gather edible mountain plants in south Hokkaidou. According to a 
graduation thesis submitted to Faculty of Letters, Hokkaidou University, in 
2013, fern pickers used to come Kaminokuni Town from Niigata Prefecture every 
spring. They stayed in huts in mountains for picking, boiling, and drying 
ferns. When the harvest season was over, fern pickers rented freight trains, 
and shipped dried fern to Oosaka.
   According to Takeo Ichikawa's book ``Nihon-no-shiki-to-kurashi (Four seasons 
and life of Japan)'' published in 1993, edible mountain plants grown in snowy 
regions are large and of good quality. A family in Murakami (Niigata 
Prefecture) earned over one million yen in one season by picking wild edible 
plants such as Zenmai ferns and blacken ferns (Warabi). 
   #8 As for old buildings in Kaminokuni, Joukokuji Temple was founded in 1443, 
and Hanazawa-date (fort) was built around the year. Tategami Shrine was founded 
in 1473, and Katsuyama-date was built around the year.
   The Sasanami's house, one of the herring mansions in Hokkaidou, is preserved 
in the center of the town. It is the oldest house in Hokkaidou, which was built 
in the early 19th century.
   These temple, shrine, and herring mansion are designated as Important 
Cultural Properties. Cf. The oldest building in the country is Houryuuji Temple 
in Nara Prefecture. It was rebuilt in the 7th century. The main buildings of 
temples have no water places such as kitchen, so temples last longer than 
ordinary houses. (See Hiyama sub-prefecture for the wood of Houryuuji temple.)
   In the past, monks in temples and priests in shrines were like civil 
servants. They recorded names of people and places. In addition, many people 
were born and many people died in the past. Therefore, there are many temples 
in old towns.)
   #9 As for old legends in Kaminokuni, Ookura herring has been told since 
1590. The story is like this;
   A certain year, no herring was caught until the end of May. The fishing 
season was over. At the time, an old monk Shuukai Ookura said to villagers, ``I 
will pray for herring to come. If you can catch herring, please share them with 
me. I will repair the temple.'' Villagers made a promise. The monk tied up a 
sacred rope, fasted, and prayed. A week later, seagulls covered the sea, 
Shikabe (albatross) gathered on the shore, whales spurted water and made big 
waves. Schools of herring came. The catch was larger than usual years and 
villagers were very happy. However, a perverse man refused to give his thanks 
to the monk, saying, ``It is just late this year, it is not your prayer.'' He 
got into a fight with the monk and the monk died. Villagers pray to the monk's 
spirit. When a small number of herring washed up in June, villagers called 
them ``Ookura herring.''
   There are other legends. These are the titles; ``the upside-down water pine 
(yew),'' ``the beheading pine,'' and ``the path of god.'' People made legends 
during the long winter. (See Yoichi Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture, Esashi 
and Otobe towns in Hiyama sub-prefecture for herring fishing.)

   Esashi [e-sa-shi] [\u6C5F\u5DEE] is a town in Hiyama sub-prefecture, south 
Hokkaidou (Dou-nan). The area faces the Sea of Japan. The shape of the town is 
like the letter ``B.'' The narrow part is the mouth of the Assabu River. Assabu 
Town is located in the upper reaches. In the Edo era, logs of Hiba (kind of 
cypress) were actively felled in mountains and transported down the Assabur 
River. The area was the center of Hiyama. The name means ``cypress mountain.''
(See Hiyama sub-prefecture for the name). #1
   The name Esashi is derived from the Ainu word e-sa-us-i (head, seashore, 
exist, place). It means a cape. It signified Kamome island in the Port of 
Esashi. The etymology is the same as Esashi Town in Souya sub-prefecture. #2 
   As for history, Ubagami-daijinguu Shrine was established in 1216. It is one 
of the oldest shrines in Hokkaidou. In the Edo era, in the late 17th century, 
the Matsumae Domain built a port to ship cypress. Herring fishing also thrived. 
The old fisherman's song Esashi-oiwake includes the following lyrics; ``Esashi 
no gogatsu wa Edo nimo nai'' (May in Esashi is nowhere even in Edo (now the 
center of Tokyo)). During the herring fishing season, many fishermen gathered, 
and the Port of Esashi became bustling. Esashi was one of the largest 
ports of the Matsumae Domain along with Fukuyama (Matsumae) and Hakodate. #3
   In 1868 (Meiji 1), during the Boshin War, the former Tokugawa Shogunate 
forces occupied Esashi. In 1869 (Meiji 2), the Meiji government forces 
recaptured Esashi. They advanced to Hakodate and defeated the former Tokugawa 
Shogunate forces. In 1872 (Meiji 5), Esashi office of Hokkaidou Development 
Commission was established. Administrative offices (kochou-yakuba) were 
established for 26 towns in the built-up area of Esashi. They were a 
continuation of town chief from the Edo era. In 1880 (Meiji 13), a county 
office (gun-yakusho) for Hiyama and Nishi [\u723E\u5FD7] counties was 
established. In 1897 (Meiji 30), Hiyama sub-prefecture (Hiyama-shichou) was 
established, and the county office was abolished. In 1900 (Meiji 33), Esashi 
Town (1st-class municipality) was established by the merger of Esashi 26 towns 
and Gokatte [\u4E94\u52DD\u624B] village. (See the note of Matsumae Town in 
Oshima sub-prefecture for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities). #4
   In 1955 (Shouwa 30), Esashi Town merged Tomari [\u6CCA] Village. The shape 
of Tomari was like the letter ``B.'' #5
   Esashi's town hall, Hiyama sub-prefecture bureau, and the Port of Esashi are 
located to the south. The port is the terminal of National Route 227 (Oono-
kokudou) and National Route 228 (Matsumae-kokudou). A ferry line connects 
Esashi and Okushiri island. Previously, the Esashi Line connected Esashi, 
Kikonai, and Hakodate.
   Near the mouth of the Assabu River, National Route 227 and National Route 
229 (Hiyama-kokudou) branch off. National Route 227 turns east, runs along the 
river, crosses the ridge, and leads to the Oono Plain (Hakodate Plain). It was 
one of the routes by which the Meiji government forces advanced to Goryoukaku 
[go-ryou-kaku] Castle during the Boshin War.
   Distinctive industries of Esashi are fishery and sightseeing. FARMING; paddy 
rice 268 hectares in 2015, beans (soybeans 112, adzuki beans 20, other beans 
1), potatoes 48, wheat 32, broccoli 21, pasture 13, fodder 7, orchards 4, 
flowers 3, yams 1, tomatoes 1, other vegetables 35+X, other grains 28; and 
dairy cows X (concealed) in 2015.
   FISHERY; red snow crabs 438 tons in 2017, squid (flying squid 314, other 
squid 2), octopus 59, sea urchins 25, salmon 19, olive flounder 15, yellowtail 
7, atka mackerel 7, shellfish 6 (including Ezo-baka-gai (mactra), abalone), 
seaweed (Konbu kelp 1, other seaweed 5), Pacific cod 5, right-eye flounder 4, 
trout 3, shrimp/prawns 3, sharks 1, herring 1, other fish 51, and other marine 
animals 20 (including sea cucumbers).
   Tourist destinations in Esashi are Kamome island (seagull island), Kaiyou-
maru Memorial Hall (a battle ship during the Boshin War), the former Nakamura 
residence (old merchant's mansion), and a marina in the Port of Esashi. #6 #7 
#8 #9
 
   #1 As for vegetation, Hiyama-koji-no-mori (Hiyama ancient forest) is 
designated as National Natural Monument. It is located near the border with 
Kaminokuni Town. Natural Hinoki-asunaro (kind of cypress) and Ao-todomatsu 
(kind of fir) are preserved in the protected area. The border is far from the 
center. 
   Esasi-sou (Esashi grass) is a kind of white mullein. The plant was imported 
from Europe in the Meiji period. It naturalized in Esashi Town after the war.
   #2 As for the name Esashi, another interpretation is the Ainu word e-sas-us 
(eat, Konbu kelp, exist). There is a legend;
   Long ago, there was a famine. The Ainu of the north coast came here and 
survived on Konbu kelp.
   (See Shin-hidaka Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture for Konbu kelp).
   #3 As for the history of Esashi, the festival of Ubagami-daijinguu Shrine 
has continued since 1644. It is one of the oldest festivals in the island. 
   Matsuura Takeshiro, who recorded place names in Ezo (now Hokkaidou), spent a 
winter in Esashi during his 2nd survey in 1846. He earned travel expenses by 
carving seals.
   Esashi-oiwake is a folk song from the Edo era. It relates to herring 
fishing. The lyrics are diverse. These are two of them;
   ``Kuniwo hanarete ah ezogashima yansanoee ikuyo nezameno namimakura.''
   (Left the country, ah, came to Ezo island, yansanoee, how many nights have 
    I woken up with the waves as my pillow.
   ``Naniwo yumemite nakukayo chidori nee kokowa esashino karino yado.''
   (What are you calling and dreaming, seagulls?, nee, this is a temporary 
    lodging in Esashi.)
   In the past, herring shoals spawned off the coast of the island from March 
to May. Herring were processed into herring meal and transported to Oosaka by 
Kitamae-bune (northern-bound ship), where they were sold to fertilizer 
wholesalers. Herring was also processed into Migaki (dried herring for eat) and 
shipped to Naichi (main island).
   In the Edo era, herring meal and dried sardines were used as Kinpi, which 
meant ``gold fertilizer'' or ``money fertilizer'' in Japanese. Farmers started 
to buy fertilizer with money, although farmers previously used leaf litter, 
livestock manure, and human manure as fertilizers. The money fertilizer Kinpi 
was used for commercial crops such as indigo, rapeseed, and cotton. (For 
herring fishing, see Yoichi Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture, Otobe Town, and 
Kaminokuni Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture.)
   #4 As for the history of Esashi, the Gokatte River and the Port of Gokatte 
are located to the south of the center of Esashi. Gokkate-ya-youkan (sweet bean 
paste) is a souvenir from Esashi. In the Edo era, Gokatte-gumi (a group of 
lumberjacks) came from the Nanbu region (today's Iwate and Aomori prefectures). 
Besides felling trees, they succeeded in cultivating adzuki-beans. They made 
sweet adzuki-bean paste and presented it to the lord of the Matsumae Domain. 
   #5 As for the former Tomari Village, which was merged in 1955, an 
administrative office (kochou-yakuba) was built in 1878 (Meiji 11) (by ``2016 
Esashi-chou-kyouiku-suishin-keikaku''). In 1906 (Meiji 39), Tomari Village 
(2nd-class municipality) was established.
   Before 1955, there were three Tomari villages in Hokkaidou; Tomari in Esashi 
county (Hiyama sub-prefecture), Tomari in Furuu county (Shiribeshi sub-
prefecture), and Tomari in Kunashiri county (Kunashir island). (See Tomari Town 
in Shiribeshi for the place name.)
   #6 Kamome island in Esashi is a tombolo (linked island). ``Kamome'' means 
seagull in Japanese. These are tourist destinations in Kamome island; Heishi 
Rock - it looks like a religious vase; Senjou-jiki - a large flat rock eroded 
by waves (Senjou means 1000 tatami mats); Yoshitsune-no-uma-iwa - a white rock 
that looks like the horse of Yoshitsune Minamoto; Benkei-no-ashiato - 
footprints of Benkei Musashibou (He was a vassal of Yoshitsune Minamoto); 
Tokugawa Shogunate battery site - set up by the Matsumae Domain in 1852; and 
a sand beach for summer vacation. (See Biratori Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture
and Otobe Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for Yoshitsune legends).
   #7 Kaiyou-maru was a battleship of the Tokugawa Shogunate. It was made in 
the Netherlands. During the Boshin War, the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces 
advanced from Hakodate to Matsumae and Esashi. The battleship also headed from 
Hakodate to Esashi. After the occupation of Esashi, in December 1869 (Meiji 1), 
the battleship ran aground and sank due to a strong wind. The wind is called 
``Taba-kaze (Taba wind),'' a locally blown strong winter wind. 
   The shogunate's commander Toshizou Hijikata thought of the sunken ship and 
cried, hitting the trunk of a pine tree. Later, a not appeared on the pine tree 
and came to be called ``Toshizou's fist.'' It is the Pine of Lament (nageki-no-
matsu) in front of the old administrative office for Hiyama and Nishi counties. 
(See Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the Bohin War.)
   #8 As for the local wind Taba-kaze, which sank the battleship Kaiyou-maru, 
blows from the northwest in winter. Japanese fishermen feared the wind. They 
believed that the wind had a soul and called it Tama-kaze (soul wind). It 
changed to Taba-kaze.
   Houses in Esashi were surrounded by fences in winter. The fences were made 
of tree branches. The sound of the wind hitting the fences was called ``Mogari-
bue (Mogari-fence's whistle).'' That was the sound-scape of Esashi in winter. 
Today, there are windmills on the mountains, which are managed by Esashi Wind 
Power (a subsidiary of J-Power).
   These are local winds in Hokkaidou; Taba-kaze (Hiyama sub-prefecture), 
Dashi-kaze (Suttsu Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture), Hidaka-shimo-kaze 
(Samani Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture), Shikata (Erimo Town in Hidaka sub-
prefecture), Aikaze (Ishikari City in Ishikari sub-prefecture), and Bafun-kaze 
(Obihiro City in Tokachi sub-prefecture and other places).
   In the past, due to strong winds in early spring, 60 herring fishing boats 
sank off Teuri island. (See Haboro Town in Rumoi sub-prefecture.) A novel 
that depicts a man-eating bear mentiones Kuma-kaze (bear wind). It blew after 
the man-eating bear was killed. (See Tomamae Town in Rumoi sub-prefecture for 
the incident.)
   Long ago, an elderly Ainu woman whose name was Orii lived near the Port of 
Esashi. She was a prophet and predicted weather and wind. She also said that 
the net for herring fishing should be 5-shaku 3-sun (160cm) and has 63 meshes 
(not large, coarse). During the Edo era, people followed her words.
   #9 As for old architecture in Esashi, the former Nakamura's residence has 
been designated as an Important Cultural Property of Japan. It was built from 
the end of the Edo era to the Meiji period. The owner was a merchant from Oumi 
(now Shiga Prefecture). The Nakamura's residence was a shipping wholesaler. 
The buildings of the residence are connected by passages. The architecture is 
called kaisen-donya-kenchiku [\u56DE\u8239\u554F\u5C4B\u5EFA\u7BC9] (shipping 
wholesaler architecture).
   In the past, along the Port of Esashi, merchant residences like the 
Nakamura's residence were lined up. They had piers to transport cargo to ships. 
   Esashi Town and Higashi-oumi City in Shiga Prefecture are sister cities. 
Higashi-oumi was the hometown of Oumi merchants. The ships of Oomi merchants 
were called Kitamae-bune (northern-bound ships). The class of the ship is 
called Sengoku-bune. It means a ship that can carry 1000-koku of rice. One 
koku is 150 kg of rice. The sales of one voyage per ship amounted to 1000 ryou 
of money (1 koku was 1 ryou at the time). One ryou in the mid Edo era was 
equivalent to about 50,000 yen today. (See Otobe Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture 
for Sengoku-basho, which means a 1000-koku-herring trading place.)

   Assabu [a-ssa-bu] [\u539A\u6CA2\u90E8] is a town in Hiyama sub-prefecture, 
south Hokkaidou (Dou-nan). It is an inland town. The area corresponds to the 
basin of the Assabu River that flows to the Sea of Japan. (The area seems to 
face the sea, but the mouth of the Assabu River is included in Esashi Town). 
Regarding vegetation, Assabu is the northern limit of Hiba (or Hinoki Asunaro, 
a kind of cypress) and the southern limit of Todo-matsu (a kind of fir).
   The name Assabu came from the Ainu word hacam-pet (starling, river). It 
signified the Assabu River. The etymology is the same as Hassamu in Nishi Ward, 
Sapporo City. #1
   In the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain started cypress felling since the 1670s. 
Woodcutters from the main land (today's Honshuu island) migrated. After the 
Meiji period, in 1868 (Meiji 1), the Matsumae Domain established Tate Castle in 
the upper reaches of the Assabu River. The castle was used during the Boshin 
War (1868-1869). #2 #3
   In 1876 (Meiji 9), an administrative office (kochou-yakuba) of Gamushi 
[\u4FC4\u866B] village was established. It was a continuation of village chief 
from the Edo era. In 1879 (Meiji 12), an administrative office was established 
for the villages of Gamushi, Tsuchihashi [\u571F\u6A4B], Mena [\u76EE\u540D], 
and Akanuma [\u8D64\u6CBC]. In 1800 (Meiji 13), an administrative office was 
established for the villages of Gamushi, Tsuchihashi, Mena, Akanuma, and 
An-noro [\u5B89\u91CE\u5442]. (Those five villages existed in the Edo era for 
forestry). In 1801 (Meiji 14), an administrative office was established for 
the villages of Gamushi, Tsuchihashi, Mena, Akanuma, An-noro, Tate [\u9928], 
and Uzura [\u9D89].
   In 1906 (Meiji 39), Assabu Village (2nd-class municipality) was established 
by the merger of the seven villages. (See the note of Matsumae Town in Oshima 
sub-prefecture for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities). In 1963 (Shouwa 
38), Assabu Town was established.
   The town hall of Assabu and the center of the town are located near the 
confluence of Assabu and An-noro rivers. The town hall was built at the site of
Hiyama Agricultural Experiment Station. National Route 227 (Oono-kokudou) 
passes the center of the town. In the past, the national highway was called 
Uzura-sandou (Quail mountain trail). It was one of the routes that the Meiji 
government forces advanced to Hakodate.
   Distinctive industries in Assabu are agriculture and forestry. FARMING; 
beans (soybeans 484 hectares in 2015, adzuki beans 196, other beans 7), paddy 
rice 555, potatoes 489, wheat 373, buckwheat 171, sugar beets 44, orchards 37 
(grapes 21), pasture 24, broccoli 24, cabbage 22, fodder 21, barley 17, green 
onions 7, melons 6, carrots 2, yams 1, Chinese cabbage 1, spinach 1, flowers 1, 
other vegetables 346+X (including pumpkins, asparagus, sweet corn), other 
grains 77; and dairy cows - (zero) in 2015. #5
   The local specialty is May-queen. It is a popular variety of potato along 
with Danshaku (baron). The town's country sign signifies a May-queen boy or 
girl whose face is long and smooth. #6

   #1 Staling (white-cheeked starling or grey starling) is called Muku-dori in 
Japanese. It means the bird of Muku tree (a kind of deciduous broad-leaved 
tree). In Hokkaidou, the bird is also called Sakura-dori, which means ``cherry, 
bird.'' The bird migrates from the south during the cherry blossom season. (See 
Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for the cherry blossom season in 
Hokkaidou).
   #2 In the Edo era, tree felling started in early winter in Ezo (old 
Hokkaidou). The forest floor was covered in snow, providing good visibility, 
therefore, woodcutters could move easily. They cut cypress. (Cypress is 
different between Hokkaidou and Honshuu islands; See Hiyama sub-prefecture.) 
They hauled logs to the Assabu River using sleds. In spring, melting snow 
flooded the river, and woodcutters floated the logs downstream.
   The woodcutters in Assabu brought their Shishi-odori (dear dance) from their 
homeland. The dance became an annual event at the Hiyama guardhouse. (The 
guardhouse (ban-sho) was managed by the Matsumae Domain.)
   In 1695, a large forest fire occurred. From 1770 to 1807, the Matsumae 
Domain banned logging to prevent deforestation. In 1876, another large forest 
fire occurred. Therefore, very few natural forests remain. In Assabu, only 
Uzura-gawa-goyou-matsu-jisei-hokugen-chitai (the northern limit of white pine 
natural growing area along the Uzura River) has been designated as National 
Natural Monument since 1928. (See Esashi Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for 
another natural forest.)
   As for sled, people have used sleds since ancient times. Parents move their 
children using plastic sleds in Sapporo today. As for snowy mountains, a female 
member of Hokkaidou University Mountaineering Club said, ``When it snows, we 
can go into mountains that we could not in summer.''
   #3 Tate Castle in Assabu was built inland to avoid naval artillery. Cf. the 
capital of the Choushuu Domain (now Yamaguchi Prefecture) moved from Hagi along 
the coast to inland Yamaguchi in 1863. (The Edo era ended in 1867.)
   In December 1868 (Meiji 1) (November of the lunar calendar at the time), 
during the Boshin War, the former Tokugawa Shogunate forces advanced to 
Matsumae Castle. The Matsumae Domain forces escaped to Tate Castle.
   In Tate Castle, Mikami Choujun, who was a samurai of the Matsumae Domain, 
fought using a cutting board as a shield. He was killed to allow his allies to 
escape. Tate Castle was captured and burned.
   The lord of the Matsumae Domain could find a ship in Kumaishi. He and his 
family set sail to the rough winter sea. They headed for Hirosaki. Then, the 
Matsumae Domain's forces surrendered.
   In May 1869, the Meiji government forces landed near the mouth of the 
Himekawa River (the landing place is located in today's Otobe Town). The Meiji 
government forces advanced south and occupied Esashi.
   In June 1869 (May of the lunar calendar at the time), the Meiji government 
forces advanced to Hakodate and ended the Boshin War. (See the note of Hakodate 
City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the Boshin War.)
   After the Boshin War, the Matsumae Domain was renamed the Tate Domain. In 
August 1871 (Meiji 4), all domains in Japan were abolished, and prefectures 
were established. In Hokkaidou, Tate Prefecture was established in the south, 
and the other parts were governed by the Hokkaidou Development Commission.
   In October 1871, Tate Prefecture was merged to Aomori Prefecture. In 1872 
(Meiji 5), the Hokkaidou Development Commission governed the whole Hokkaidou, 
including the former Tate Prefecture. Meiji was a turbulent period. (New 
religions also emerged during the period; See Hokkaidou University in Sapporo 
City for new religions.)
   #4 As for the place name Gamushi, it came from the Ainu word kamuy-us-i 
(god, exist, place). Probably the god meant bear. (See Noboribetsu City in 
Iburi sub-prefecture for bear.) Today, there is Gamushi Hot Spring along the 
tributary of the An-noro River.
   #5 As for beans, the specialties of Assabu are Hikari-kuro-daizu (shining 
black soybeans) and black-bean pudding. Black soybeans are suitable for machine 
harvesting because the color hides stains of the juice (astringents or tannins) 
from the stems.
   #6 The potato cultivar May-queen was bred in 1900 by the British seed 
company Sutton & Sons. May-queen was named after the queen chosen at the May 
Day festival. May-qeen was imported to Japan from the USA during the Taishou 
period (1912-1925). In 1928 (Shouwa 3), Hiyama Agricultural Experiment Station 
designated May-queen and Danshaku as recommended potato cultivars. The 
agricultural station was located in Gamushi district, Assabu Village. (See 
Imakane Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture and Kutchan Town in Shiribeshi sub-
prefecrtue for Danshaku potato.)
   May-queen is a popular ingredient in Oden (winter pot dish) in the Kansai 
region (central Honshuu island), because the potatoes do not fall apart when 
they are soaked in hot soup for a long time. (I grew up in eastern Japan and 
have never seen potatoes in Oden.)
   Sapporo Shusei is a distiller located along the Assabu River. It makes 
Shouchuu (liquor) distilled from potatoes and sweet potatoes that are 
cultivated in south Hokkaidou. (I did not know that sweet potatoes are 
cultivated in Hokkaidou as a commercial crop. Sweet potatoes are cultivated 
under a warm climate.) Next to the distiller is the agricultural cooperative's 
potato shipping center. (See Nishi Ward in Sapporo City for liquor production.)

   Otobe [o-to-be] [\u4E59\u90E8] is a town in Hiyama sub-prefecture, south 
Hokkaidou (Dou-nan). It is located in the west of the Oshima Peninsula, facing 
the Sea of Japan. The area is mountainous. Forests occupy 87% of the area.
   The name Otobe was derived from the Ainu word o-to-un-pe (river mouth, 
swamp, exist, thing (river)). It signified the Hime River that flows through 
the center of the town. In the Edo era, the river was called Otohe (by 
Takeshirou Matsuura's map published in 1859; http://
koukita.github.io/touzaiezo/map/). #2
   In the Edo era, the area was governed by the Matsumae Domain. Herring 
fishing thrived. According to oral tradition, Hanaiso Suwa Shrine was 
established in 1617 (Genna 3). (The name of the shrine was recorded in 1704). 
After the Meiji period, the new Meiji government forces landed Otobe in May 
1869 (Meiji 2). They advanced to Esashi and Hakodate, and defeated the former 
Tokugawa Shogunate forces. (The Boshin War ended.)
   In 1879 (Meiji 12), administrative offices (kochou-yakuba) were established 
for the villages of Otobe, Komonai [\u5C0F\u8302\u5185], Toppu [\u7A81\u7B26], 
Mitsuya [\u4E09\u30C4\u8C37], and Kabashira [\u868A\u67F1]. In 1902 (Meiji 35), 
Otobe Village (2nd-class municipality) was established by the merger of the 
five villages. (See the note of Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 1st-
class and 2nd class municipalities.) In 1965 (Shouwa 40), Otobe Town was 
established. #3 #4
   The town hall of Otobe is located near the mouth of the Hime River. National 
Route 229 (Hiyama-kokudou) runs along the sea. The road connects old 
settlements that flourished in fishery or forestry. #5
   Distinctive industries in Otobe are fishery, agriculture, fish processing, 
and forestry. FARMING; paddy rice 127 hectares in 2015, soybeans 89, broccoli 
26, adzuki beans 17, fodder 9, pasture 4, strawberries 2, orchards 2, radishes 
1, other vegetables 32+X (including lily bulbs), other grains 20; and dairy 
cows - (zero) in 2015.
   FISHERY; walleye pollock 286 tons in 2017, squid (flying squid 214, other 
squid 1), sea urchins 39, octopus 32, salmon 13, Pacific cod 5, olive flounder 
3, Konbu kelp 3, shrimp/prawns 2, yellowtail 1, right-eye flounder 1, atka 
mackerel 1, abalone 1, herring 0, other fish 17, animals 16 (including sea 
cucumbers). Fishing ports are located in Otobe, Genna, and Toyohama.
   As for other industries in Otobe, CAC Cosmetics factory and Tomioka Winery 
are located. The founder of CAC Cosmetics was born in a pharmacy in Otobe. 
Tomioka Winery was founded in 1976. Today, it is run by the distilling compnay 
Sapporo-shusei (the headquarter is located in Nishi Ward, Sapporo City). 
Thomioka Winery sells Otobe wine.
   As for sightseeing, Gennadai Beach Park has been selected as one of the 100 
Beaches of Japan. It was designated by the Ministry of the Environment). It is 
the only 100 Beaches in Hokkaidou. The country sign (gateway sign) of Otobe 
Town depicts the artificial seawater pool at Gennadai Beach Park. Other scenic 
sites include; 1) Cape Shibi-no-saki, which is andesite columnar joints that 
resemble tuna scales (``Shibi'' means tuna in old Japanese), 2) Cape 
Tateno-saki, whose nickname is the Grand Canyon of the Orient, 3) and Takise 
coast, which is known for Shira-hura (white sea cliff). #6

   #1 The Kanji characters for Nishi county (Nishi-gun) are difficult to read 
even for the Japanese. In the beginning of the Meiji period, Takeshirou 
Matsuura, an explorer of Ezo (now Hokkaidou), suggested Nishi-gun 
[\u897F\u90E1] (west county) for the county name, however, the Meiji government 
adopted the difficult Kanji characters because there were identical place names 
in Honshuu island.
   #2 As for the former river name Otohe (``river mouth, swamp, exist, thing'' 
in Ainu), there were many ponds and swamps in the lower reaches of the Hime 
Rivier. They were reclaimed and turned into paddy fields and a built-up area. 
Today's river name Hime means ``princess'' or ``noble lady'' in Japanese. In 
the case of Otobe Town, it refers to Shizuka-gozen, who was the wife of 
Yoshitsune Minamoto.
   Yoshitsune Minamoto was the commander of the Minamoto clan in the 12th 
century. He was killed in battle in Oushuu (now Touhoku region), however, many 
legends mention that he fled to Ezo (old Hokkaidou). This is one of them in 
Otobe; Shizuka-gozen came here in search of her husband but she could not find 
him, because he had escaped far inland. She was disappointed and committed 
suicide by drowning in the river. Then, the river was called the Hime River. 
(See Biratori Town in Hidaka sub-prefecture and Esashi Town in Hiyama sub-
prefecture for Yoshitsune's legend.)
   #3 During the Tenmei period (1781-1789) in the Edo era, Otobe was Sengoku-
basho of herring. Sengoku-basho means ``a trading place that has 1000-koku 
catches of herring.'' At the time, one koku was equivalent to 150 kg of dried 
herring or 200 kg of fresh herring. (See the note of Esashi Town in Hiyama sub-
prefecture for the Sengoku-bune, which means 1000-koku ship.)
   During the Tenmei Famine (1782-1788) and the Tenpou Famine (1833-1839), 
people migrated to Otobe from Nanbu (now Iwate and Aomori prefectures), 
Hirosaki (now Aomori Prefecture), and Akita. In Otobe Town, there are districts 
of Sakaehama (``thriving beach'' in Japanese) and Toyohama (``rich beach'').
They remind us of the good old days. Herring disappeared in 1917 (Taishou 6). 
(See Yoichi Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture and Esashi Town in Hiyama sub-
prefecture for herring fishing).
   #4 In December 1868 (Meiji 1) (November of the lunar calendar at the time), 
during the Boshin War, the Tokugawa Shogunate forces advanced to the castle 
of the Matsumae Domein (now Matsumae Town).
   The Matsumae Domain forces escaped to Tate Castle in Assabu. Tate Castle 
also fell and the Matsumae Domain forces escaped to Otobe. The lord of the 
Matsumae Domain escaped to Hirosaki and the rest of Matsumae Domain forces 
surrendered. Villagers in Otobe hid some Matsumae soldiers by dressing them in 
farmer's clothes. (See Hakodate City in Oshima sub-prefecture for the Boshin 
War; See Assabu Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture for the end of the Matsumae 
Domain.)
   #5 The name Otobe-juujigai is located in the center of the town. Juujigai 
in Japanese means crossroad. The place name Juujigai also remains in Fukagawa, 
Hakodate, Kushiro, Okushiri, Otobe, Shikaoi, Rumoi, and Yoichi in Hokkaidou.
   In contrast to crossroad (juujigai), castle towns in Honshuu island have 
T-junctions (teiji-ro) and S-shaped curves (kaguino-te). The complicated roads 
were constructed for defensive purposes. Today, the roads are obstructs for 
vehicular traffic.
   In Japan, motorization started after the 1960s. (My father bought Nissan 
Cherry in the 1970s.) In the USA, according to the novel The Grapes of Wrath, 
farmers fled to California by cars and trucks in the 1930s. Motorization 
in the USA started in the early 20th century.
   #6 Gennadai in Otobe is named after the Genna period (1615-1624) in the Edo 
era. The fishing port Genna was built in the period. It is an old fishing port.
   To the north of Cape Shibi-no-saki, there was Kabashira district. The Port 
of Toyohama is located there. Kabashira is a funny name. It means ``mosquito 
pillar'' in Japanese. The name came from the Ainu word kapara-sirar (flat, 
rock). (Once, I saw a big mosquito pillar in a room of lodge in the tropics.)
   As for Shira-fura cliff, I guess that the name came from the Ainu word 
sirar-hu-ra (rock, raw, intestine). The eroded cliff looks like intestines of 
fish.

   Okushiri [o-ku-shi-ri] [\u5965\u5C3B] is a town in Hiyama sub-prefecture, 
south Hokkaidou (Dou-nan). The area is Okushiri island in the Sea of Japan. It 
is the second largest island in Hokkaidou after Rishiri. The area of Okushiri 
is about the same size as Lake Saroma. There are coastal terraces to the east, 
paddy field to the south, and coastal cliffs to the west and to the north. 
Forests cover 86% of the area.
   The name Okushiri was derived from the Ainu word i-kus-un-sir (it, over 
there, exist, island) or i-kus-sir (it, over there, island). Both words 
signified the island across the sea as seen from Kumaishi.
   In the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain built Kujiri-basho (a trading place) in 
the island. Herring fishing prospered through the Edo era to the Meiji period. 
In 1879 (Meiji 12), administrative offices (kochou-yakuba) were built for the 
villages of Tsurikake [\u91E3\u61F8], Akaishi [\u8D64\u77F3], Yakushi 
[\u85AC\u5E2B], and Aonae [\u9752\u82D7]. In 1906 (Meiji 39), Okushiri Village 
(2nd-class municipality) was established by the merger of the four villages. 
(See the note of Matsumae Town in Oshima sub-prefecture for 2nd-class and 1st-
class municipalities.) In 1966 (Shouwa 41), Okushiri Town was established. 
   The town hall of Okushiri is located in Okushiri district to the east. Other 
built-up areas are located in Aonae district to the south and Kamui-waki 
(Yunohama) district to the west. Heart Land Ferry connects ports of Okushiri,
Setana, and Esashi. Okushiri Airport opened in 1974 in Aonae district. 
Hokkaidou Air System connects Okushiri and Hakodate airports.
   Distinctive industries in Okushiri are fishing, food processing, and 
sightseeing. FARMING; pasture 41 hectares in 2015, paddy rice 37, orchards 31; 
dairy cows X (concealed) in 2015, and beef cattle X. FISHERY; squid (flying 
squid 417 tons in 2017, other squid 8), sea urchins 111, Pacific cod 69, 
octopus 59, atka mackerel 58, shellfish 22 (abalone, Sakuragai (mactra), 
whelks), right-eye flounder 7, puffer fish 5, seaweed 5, olive flounder 4, 
yellowtail 1, herring - (zero), other fish 52, and other marine animals 23.
   As for food processing, local specialties are rice wine (sake) and wine. As
for sightseeing, Nabetsuru Rock, the icon of the island, is located near the 
ferry port. Okushiri Tsunami Museum is located in Aonae district. The country 
sign (gateway sign) of Okuhsiri is a map of the island. It illustrates strange 
shaped rocks and Bentenguu Shrine. #1 #2 #3

   #1 In the past, Okushiri was an island of alcohol prohibition. When the 
catch of herring was poor, fishermen drunk a lot of alcohol and quarreled. So, 
village chief (kochou) banned drinking alcohol from 1885 to 1890. Today, sake 
(rice wine) and wine are the specialties of the island. There even is an 
``Ordinance to promote toasts with Okushiri's local rice wine.'' (See Asahikawa 
City in Kamikawa sub-prefecture for rice wine; See Ikeda Town in Tokachi sub-
prefecture for wine.)
   #2 Okushiri island is located near the boundary between the Eurasian Plate
and North American Plate. In July 1993, the Okushiri Earthquake, whose 
magnitude was 7.8, killed 230 people. It was due to tidal waves (tsunami), 
fires, and landslides. Being close to the epicenter, the first tidal wave 
arrived two to three minutes after the earthquake. Tidal waves caused the 
greatest damage that killed 198 people. At the time, television channels were 
broadcasting live footage from the sky. Aonae district was burning.
   In 1988, the town declared ``completion of recovery.'' In 2001, Tsunami 
Museum opened.
   As for tidal waves, the Sanriku Coast in the Touhoku region was hit by huge 
tidal waves. At an elementary school in the Sanriku Coast, all children could 
escaped from massive tidal waves in March 2011. Their grand parents taught them 
the word tsunami-tendenko. It means ``when a large earthquake comes, you must 
escape `alone' as soon as possible.''
   #3 These are strange shaped rocks in the island; 1) Nabe-tsuru Rock, which 
resembles a handle of iron pot. The shape was changed by the great earthquake 
in 1993, so it was restored, 2) Kabuto Rock (warrior's helmet rock), 3) Hoya 
Rock (sea pineapple rock), 4) Mottate Rock (erection rock), and 4) Muean-jima 
(lonely island). There are unique stories with the unique rocks. 
   Traveling to a remote island fascinates some people strongly. Time is not 
consumed there.

   Setana [se-ta-na] is a town in Hiyama sub-prefecture, south Hokkaidou (Dou-
nan). The area is located in the west of the Oshima Peninsula, facing the Sea 
of Japan. Cape Obana is the western tip of Hokkaidou island. Ordinary tourists 
cannot go to there because it is a steep sea cliff. #1 
   The area of Setana was newly established in 2005 by the merger of three 
towns; Taisei [\u5927\u6210], Kita-hiyama [\u5317\u6A9C\u5C71], and Setana 
[\u702C\u68DA] (from south to north). 
   The name Taisei means ``big success'' in Japanese. It was named by local 
residents when Kudou [\u4E45\u9060] Village and Kaitorima [\u8C9D\u53D6\u6F97] 
Villages were merged in 1955.
   The name Kita-hiyama means ``north cypress-mountain'' in Japanese. (See 
Hiyama sub-prefecture for the name Hiyama.)
   The name Setana was derived from the Ainu word seta-rupespe-nay (dog, cross, 
river). It signified a place near the Baba River, which flows the center of the 
old Setana Town. Large rocks stands near the mouth of the river. They are 
Sanbonsugi-iwa (Three-ceders Rocks) standing from the sea and Rousoku-iwa 
(Candle Rock) at the port. They look like dogs. #2
   In the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain established three places (three 
``basho'') for fishing. Each places had a trading post. The places were located 
in today's Kudou, Futoro, and Setanai districts. They thrived from herring 
fishing. (Futoro was located at the mouth of the Futoro River.)
   After the Meiji period, counties of Kudou, Futoro, and Setana were 
established in 1869 (Meiji 2). The following is the history of old three towns.
   Old Taisei Town; In 1872 (Meiji 5), Kudou office of the Hokkaidou 
Development Commission was established. In 1880 (Meiji 13), an administrative 
office (kochou-yakuba) was established in Issouma [\u4E00\u8258\u6F97] village. 
It covered other five villages; Oota [\u592A\u7530], Uekotan 
[\u4E0A\u53E4\u4E39], Sansouma [\u4E09\u8258\u6F97], Hikata-tomari 
[\u65E5\u65B9\u6CCA], and Yunoshiri [\u6E6F\u5C3B]. In the same year, an 
administrative office was established in Hiratanai [\u5E73\u7530\u5185]. It 
covered other two villages; Kaitorima and Nagaiso [\u9577\u78EF]. In 1881 
(Meiji 14), an administrative office of Kudou village was established by the 
merger of Issouma, Sansouma, and Hikata-tomari.
   In 1902 (Meiji 35), Kudou Village (2nd-class municipality) was established 
by the merger of Oota, Uekotan, and Yunoshiri. (See the note of Matsumae Town 
in Oshima sub-prefecture for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities). In 1923 
(Taishou 12), Kaitorima Village (2nd-class municipality) was established by 
the merger of Hiratanai and Nagaiso. In 1955 (Shouwa 30), Taisei Village was 
established by the merger of Kudou and Kaitorima. In 1966 (Shouwa 41), Taisei 
Town was established.
   Old Kita-hiyama Town; In 1879 (Meiji 12), an administrative office (kochou-
yakuba) was established for four villages in Futoro county (Futoro 
[\u592A\u6AD3], Gorota [\u53E4\u6AD3\u591A], Raruishi [\u826F\u7460\u77F3], and 
Udomari [\u9D5C\u6CCA]). In 1902 (Meiji 35), an administrative office of 
Higashi-setana [\u6771\u702C\u68DA] village was established. It was separated 
from Setana village. In 1906 (Meiji 39), Futoro Village (2nd-class 
municipality) was established by the merger of Futoro, Gorota, Raruishi, and 
Udomari. In the same year, Higashi-setana Village (2nd-class municipality) was 
established. In 1953 (Shouwa 28), Higashi-setana Town was established. In 1955 
(Shouwa 30), Kita-hiyama Town was established by the merger of Higashi-setana 
Town and Futoro Village.
   Old Setana Town; In 1879 (Meiji 12), two administrative offices (kochou-
yakuba) were established for five villages in Setana county (Setana, Baikatsu 
[\u6885\u82B1\u90FD], Nakauta [\u4E2D\u6B4C], Abura [\u867B\u7F85], and 
Shimauta [\u5CF6\u6B4C]). In 1897 (Meiji 30), Toshibetsu village (now Imakane 
Town) was separated from Setana. In 1902 (Meiji 35), Setana Village (2nd-class 
municipality) was established by the merger of five villages in Setana county. 
In the same year, Higashi-setana village was separated from Setana (an 
administrative office was established). In 1919 (Taishou 8), Setana Village 
(1st-class municipality) was established. In 1921 (Taishou 10), Setana Town was 
established.
   The town hall of Setana is located near the mouth of the Toshibetsu 
(Shiribeshi-toshibetsu) River. It used to be Kita-hiyama's town Hall. National 
Route 229 (Hiyama-kokudou) runs along the Sea of Japan. National Route 230 
(Pirika-kokudou) separates from National Route 229 near the town hall and 
crosses the Oshima Peninsula. Formerly, the Setana Line of the Japanese 
National Railways ran along Route 230. The railway connected Setana Station and 
Kun-nui Station in Oshamambe Town. #3
   As for the former Setana Town, the Port of Setana has a ferry line to 
Okushiri island. The windmills near the port are the first offshore windmills 
in the country. In the built-up area of Setana, there was a clinic managed by 
Guinko Oguino. She was the first female medical doctor in the country. #4 
   Distinctive industries of Setana are fishing, paddy rice cultivation, and 
dairy farming. FARMING; pasture 2046 hectares in 2015, paddy rice 1537, beans 
(soybeans 353, adzuki beans 84, other beans 7), fodder 268, potatoes 153, 
buckwheat 146, sugar beets 64, wheat 48, broccoli 23, spinach 10, orchards 5, 
radishes 3, melons 1, other vegetables 46+X (sweet corn, pumpkins, asparagus), 
other grains 11; and dairy cows 2886 head in 2015.
   FISHERY; squid (flying squid  618 tons in 2017, other squid 3), salmon 283, 
sea urchins 133, octopus 65, Pacific cod 46, seaweed (Konbu kelp 26, other 
seaweed 5), olive flounder 22, atka mackerel 19, right-eye flounder 17, 
yellowtail 16, shellfish (abalone 2, other shellfish 10 (oysters)), 
shrimp/prawns 9, sharks 4, puffer fish 2, herring 0, other fish 92, and other 
marine animals 16.
   Local specialties include the rice wine (sake) that is made from locally 
grown rice. #5

   #1 Among the northern, southern, eastern, and western tips of Hokkaidou, the 
western tip, Cape Obana in Setana Town, is the most difficult to visit because 
it is a sea cliff. Including small islands, the western tip of Hokkaidou is 
Oshima-ooshima island in Matsumae Town, Oshima sub-prefecture. It is an 
uninhabited island.
   Oota Shrine at Cape Obana is one of the oldest shrines in Hokkaidou. It was 
established around 1441. It is one of the most difficult shrines to visit. It 
is located at the top of a rocky mountain. Bears live. Visitors are like 
climbers. At the shrine, they will pray for a safety descent. In the past, 
mountaineering was a religion.
  #2 As for the name Setana, on the map published by Takeshirou Matsuura in 
1859, Haha-gawa (now Baba River) and Setaruheshi-nail (``seta-rupespe-nay'' in 
Ainu) are written together (http://koukita.github.io/touzaiezo/map/). 
   Tadashi Okudaira wrote that the upper course of the Baba River was called 
the Setanai River (by World Encyclopedia). When I asked the town hall, they 
answered that the Setanai River would signify today's Toshibetsu River 
(Shiribeshi-toshibetsu River) according to the Setanai Basho Map (Setanai 
trading place map). The map was drawn in the Ansei period (1855-1860) in the 
Edo era.
   Some river names and place names changed from Ainu to Japanese in Hiyama and 
Oshima sub-prefectures because the regions have a long history of Japanese 
settlement, for example; Baba River in Setana, Hime River in Otobe, and 
Torisaki River in Mori. (See the note of Oshamanbe Town in Oshima sub-
prefecture for the typical river names in Ainu.)
   As for the name Seta-nai (``dog, river'' in Ainu), there is a legend of 
Ainu; Once upon a time, large dogs that were messengers of god came down from 
the mountains, went into the sea, and turned into rocks.
   At the 1993 Okushiri Earthquake, tidal waves (tsunami) surrounded Sanbonsugi 
Rocks and reached the national highway (Route 229). After the water subsided, 
sea urchins and flounders were left on the road.
  #3 National Route 229 runs along the coast of Setana. It temporally runs 
inland at the border between the former Taisei and Kita-hiayama towns. It 
detours Cape Obana, which is a sea cliff at the western tip of Hokkaidou 
island. Strange-shaped rocks are located along the coastal highway; Mother Bear 
and Cub Rock, Mammoth Rock, and Raccoon Rock.
  #4 As for Guinko Oguino (1851-1913), she was born in Tawarase village 
(today's Kumagaya City, Saitama Prefecture). In 1885, she passed medical 
practitioner's examination and opened a clinic of gynecology and obstetrics in 
Yushima, Tokyo. She became the first female medical doctor in the country.
   Her husband Yukiyoshi Shikata started developing Immanuel district in 1891. 
Immanual was located in today's Imakane Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture, 
Hokkaidou island. Guinko moved to Immanuel in 1894. Her husband failed in 
development and became a missionary. (See the note of Imakane Town for 
Christian's development.)
   In 1897, Guinko moved to the seaside town Setana and opened a clinic. In 
1903, she went to Sapporo to have a larger clinic, however, she was told that 
her medical technique was 20 years' behind, so she returned to Setana. In 1905, 
her husband died. In 1908, she returned to Tokyo.
   Incidentally, about medical doctor, I lived in a teachers' apartment in 
Sapporo. Next to the apartment was a clinic for internal medicine and 
pediatrics. The elderly doctor said; I was originally internist, so when I 
added pediatrics, my friends scorned me, but I had to raise my children.
   He was proud that his three sons became medical doctors. When I went to his 
clinic with the influenza, the doctor said; The latest machine to test the 
influenza is expensive. The debt remains with my son.
   After his sudden death, one of his sons came from a hospital and succeeded 
the clinic for about a year. Then, the clinic was demolished and an apartment 
was built.
   #5 Rice wine production in Setana was treated by a graduation thesis 
submitted to Faculty of Letters, Hokkaidou University.
   The producers of the rice wine are farmers. They cultivate paddy rice and 
brew rice wine. They sell two trade-marks of sake; Guinko-monogatari (Guinko's 
story) and Yoshiko. 
   Guinko-monogatari is made from the brewery rice that is cultivated by rice-
duck farming method, a kind of organic agriculture. Yoshiko is made from Kirara 
397, a common rice variety for eat. (See Uryuu Town in Sorachi sub-prefecture 
for Kirara 397.)
   The producers wanted to use the names Kita-hiyama (old town's name) and 
Suisen (daffodils, the town's flower) insted of Guinko and Yoshiko, but those 
names were already trademarked. The name Yoshiko was chosen because it was a 
common name in the town, such as rice wine producer's wife and mother.
   The cultivation of brewery rice is difficult in Hokkaidou, so the rice wine 
producers also use a common variety for eat (Kirara 397). Grains of brewery 
rice are large so they does not crumble easily after being scraped off.
   Cf. Hokkaidou's wine is also made from the table grape variety Niagara. 
Locally grown mountain grapes (Yama-budou) are also used.
   As for brewery rice, Yamada-nishiki is the most famous variety in the 
country. It is used for the rice wine made in the Nada region (now Hyougo 
Prefecture, located in the central part of Honshuu island). Nada is famous for 
rice wine production. The Nada's rice wine was shipped to Ezo (now Hokkaidou) 
by northern-bound ships. It is said that the rice wine transported by ship 
tastes better. (See Asahikawa City in Kamikawa sub-prefecture and Mashike Town 
in Rumoi sub-prefecture for rice wine; See Ikeda Town in Tokachi sub-prefecture 
for wine.)

   Imakane [i-ma-ka-ne] [\u4ECA\u91D1] is a town in Hiyama sub-prefecture, 
south Hokkaidou (Dou-nan). The area is located inland in the Oshima Peninsula. 
It corresponds to the midstream and upstream of the Shiribeshi-toshibetsu 
River, which flows to the Sea of Japan. Local residents call the river 
Toshibetsu River. The downstream of the river is Setana Town.
   The name Imakane is Japanese. It was derived from two pioneers Toujirou 
Imamura and Ishirou Kanamori (Ima- and Kane-). Both of them were graduates of 
Tokyo Professional School (now Waseda University).
   In the Edo era, the Matsumae Domain gathered gold dust in the upstream of 
the Shiribetsu-toshibetsu River. In the Meiji period, there were agate and 
manganese mines.
   As for the history after the Meiji period, in 1893 (Meiji 26), two pioneers 
settled in what is now Imakane district. In the same year, a group of 
Christians settled in Immanuel district. In 1897 (Meiji 30), an administrative 
office (kochou-yakuba) of Toshibetsu [\u5229\u5225] village was established. It 
was separated from Setana village. In 1906 (Meiji 39), Toshibetsu Village (2nd-
class municipality) was established. (See the note of Matsumae Town in Oshima 
sub-prefecture for 1st-class and 2nd-class municipalities.) In 1929 (Shouwa 4), 
Toshibetsu Village (1st-class municipality) was established. In 1947 (Shouwa 
22), Imakane Town was established. Toshibetsu was renamed to Imakane. #1
   The town hall of Imakane and the center of the town are located along the 
midstream of the Shiribeshi-toshibetsu River. National Route 230 (Pirika-
kokudou or Hanaishi-douro) run there. In the past, the Setana Line ran along 
the river. The railroad crossed the Oshima peninsula, connecting Setana and 
Kun-nui. (Setana Station was located in the former Setana Town. Kun-nui 
Station on the Hakodate Main Line is located in Oshamambe Town). #2 #3 #4
   Distinctive industries of Imakane are agriculture, animal husbandry, and 
forestry. FARMING; pasture 1446 hectares in 2015, paddy rice 1414, beans 
(soybeans 376, adzuki beans 208), potatoes 396, wheat 273, fodder 229, sugar 
beets 117, buckwheat 69, carrots 32, broccoli 24, barley 19, tomatoes 13, 
onions 5, other grains 24; dairy cows 2021 head in 2015, and hogs and pigs X 
(concealed).
   Potatoes are sold with the trade-mark Imakane-danshaku. As for animal 
husbandry, swine farms of Nippon Ham Group are distributed in mountains. As for 
sightseeing, Pirika Dam is located near Pirika Pass. The dam has very long 
concrete dyke. It stands out from National Route 230. The country sign (gateway 
sign) of the town is Piiri and Piika, which are nicknames for sea cow fossils 
excavated from the dam construction site. #5 #6

   #1 As for the history of Imakane, a Christian group settled in Immanuel 
district. They tried to make their utopia. The name Immanuel means ``God with 
us'' in Hebrew. It was today's Kamioka district. The name Kamioka means ``god 
hill'' in Japanese.
   The first female doctor in Japan, Guinko Oguino, came Immanuel because her 
husband was a member of the group. (See Setana Town in Hiyama sub-prefecture 
for her clinic.)
   On the map published by Takeshiro Matsuura in 1859 (http://koukita.github.
io/touzaiezo/map/), there is a place name written as Imanpetsu. It may come 
from the Ainu word i-ma-un-pet (it, burn (or swim), exist, river). 
   The Christians may have imagined the word Immanuel from the pronunciation. 
(Updated in 2024; The place name on the map may be Imashipetsu. It may come 
from the Ainu word i-ma-si-pet (it, burn, large, river). Japanese Katakana 
characters are sometimes difficult to distinguish.)
   #2 As for Hanaishi district in Imakane Town, the name means agate in 
Japanese. The district near Pirika Dam was the largest agate mine in the 
country in the Meiji period. The agate was shipped to Fukui Prefecture and 
carved into ornaments.
   Today, agate is mainly imported from Brazil. When I visited Sao Paulo, 
Brazil, I entered a souvenir shop. A Japanese man who also looked souvenirs in 
the shop recommended me to buy agate chopstick rests. He was a president of a 
Japanese construction company operating in Brazil. Pointing at chopstick rests 
of various colors, he said, ``Agate is colored, but this color is natural.''
   #3 Near the center of Imakane Town, a large loop bridge stands out. It 
continues up to Hikaridai district, which is an agricultural area on a hill. 
The loop bridge looks like an expressway but it is an agricultural road 
(Nou-men-douro), which was built with gasoline tax. The construction of the 
road was like the deduction of gasoline tax for agricultural machines.
   Other loop bridges are located in Sunagawa (Sorach sub-prefecture), Toyoura 
(Iburi sub-prefecture), and Asari district in Otaru (Shiribeshi sub-prefecture).
   #4 The name of post office in the town office is Imagane (not Imakane). The 
name of the former railroad station was Imagane. The name on the map by the 
Geographical Survey Institute is Imakane.
   The town's former name was Toshibetsu, which came from the Ainu word tus-pet 
(snake (or rope), river) or to-us-pet (pond, many, river). It signified the 
Shiribeshi-toshibetsu River.
   The Shiribeshi-toshibetsu river was ranked as the cleanest river of Japan 
issued in Current Water Quality of Class A Rivers in The Country (Zenkoku-
ikkyuu-kasen-no-suishitsu-genkyou) published by the Ministry of Land, 
Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. (See Rankoshi Town in Shiribeshi sub-
prefecture for the cleanest rivers.)
   #5 As for agriculture in Imakane, Danshaku (baron) is a popular potato 
cultivar as well as May-queen for eating. Cf. Kona-fubuki is the major potato 
cultivar for processing.
   The production of potatoes in Imakane is not so large compared to 
the municipalities in Tokachi sub-prefecture, but the potatoes have a 
reputation for quality. One of the reasons is that the smaller size of the 
farm. Farmers take time in each potato field. For example, they remove all 
nora-imo (stray potatoes), which are the rest of the former harvest and give a 
bad impact on the next cultivation. I heard this phrase from a former high 
school teacher; ``Potatoes are cultivated after potatoes in Dou-nan (south 
Hokkaidou).''
   In Tokahi sub-prefecture, potatoes are cultivated in a rotation with beans, 
wheat, and sugar beets. The so-called stray potatoes were killed by the cold 
temperature in Tokachi, but not all of them are killed recently because of 
climate change. (See Kutchan Town in Shiribeshi sub-prefecture for Danshaku 
potato; See Assabu Town in Hiyama for May-queen potato; See Shihoro Town in 
Tokachi sub-prefecture for general potato production.)
   #6 The width of Pirika Dam is 1480m. It is the longest concrete dam in the 
country. The dam was constructed between 1975 and 1991 at the confluence of the 
rivers of Shiribeshi-toshibetsu, Pirikabetsu, and Chuushibetsu. The water of 
the dam lake is used for power generation, irrigation, and flood control. 
Driftwood collected in the dame lake is distributed free of charge for personal 
use such as for wood stoves and gardening.
   Kur Plaza Pirika is located in front of the dam. The plaza includes a hot 
spring, a ski resort, and a restaurant. The specialty of the restaurant is dam 
curry. Rice blocks the curry like a dam.
   In the upstream of the Pirikabetsu River, there is Okupirika hot spring 
along Prefectural Route 999. The name Pirikabetsu means a beautiful river in 
Ainu. The Kanji characters for Pirika [\u7F8E\u5229\u6CB3] also means 
``beautiful, gain, river.''
